  <h1 class="discord-intro-head">Introduction</h1>
  <p class="discord-intro-content">
    Having access to all the games that you and your friends play and the 
    gaming communities you’re a part of, is a lot of information found in 
    one place. In addition, when one creates a Discord server, they can 
    customize the text of their channels and setting categories for what 
    role each member has in the community. All of this can cause information 
    overload and lead to a lack of visual hierarchy.
    <br><br>
    Having this in mind, I saw an opportunity to add touches to Discord’s 
    features that I believe could potentially improve user experience.

<div class="discord-brief">
  <h1 class="discord-brief-head">What is Discord?</h1>
  <p class="discord-brief-content">
    Discord is a voice, video and text platform that was designed to allow 
    gamers to connect with one another. Users can join and create their 
    own servers where they can interact with multiple communities in a 
    matter of a few clicks.
    <br><br>
    Now, non-gaming communities are taking advantage of Discord’s 
    services to connect with their networks.

<div class="discord-gamers">
  <h1 class="discord-gamers-head">The World Gamers Live In</h1>
  <p class="discord-gamers-content">
    If you’re a gamer, you will know that gamers live in a fast-paced 
    environment. They have quick access to everything they need and if 
    one thinks about it, gaming is a great example of user experience. 
    Gamers don’t have to think about the location of the platforms 
    they use and the sooner they can move from A to B, the happier 
    they will be. They are so accustomed to having access to everything 
    so quickly, that anything that will cause poor user experience, such 
    as a sudden disconnection, can make a gamer rage.

    I mentioned the general purpose of Discord, but let’s dig deeper 
    on some of the reasons why gamers use this platform.
    <br><br>
    I wrote my research and potential ideas onto a whiteboard.

<div class="discord-pain">
  <h1 class="discord-pain-head">The Pain Point</h1>
  <p class="discord-pain-content">
    The pain point is visual hierarchy. With a copious 
    amount of text placed around the app, some features 
    lack breathing room and that can make the user think 
    everything is cluttered and unorganized.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="discord-tweaks">
  <h1 class="discord-tweaks-head">Potential Tweaks</h1>
  <p class="discord-pain-content">
    After studying Discord’s current version as of 
    March 10, 2020, I saw an opportunity to tweak 
    the typography of the channel section found in a 
    server and adding categories on the “online friends” 
    tab to help organize the user’s friends list.
  </p>

  <h3 class="server-channels">Server Channels</h3>
  <p class="server-channels-content">
    The creator of a server has the freedom to customize 
    their channels. They can add multiple channels and even 
    add emojis as an aesthetic. However, this could lead to 
    information overload. For example, I asked a friend if I 
    could feature sections of their Discord onto this case study.
  </p>

  <div class="server-channels-img">
    <img class="discord-channels-red" src="Discord/channel-original-red.png">

    <p class="server-channels-content2">
      On the image to the left, you can see that emojis are paired 
      with a list of text. One problem here is that the point size 
      of the channel headers (highlighted in red) are smaller than 
      the chat logs. Also, adding emojis can make it harder for the 
      user to figure out what needs to be read first.
      <br><br>
      Looking at the text from a distance, you can see that there 
      isn’t enough contrast in the typography and the user may struggle 
      on what needs to be read first.
      <br><br>
      Getting rid of the channel headers and leaving a list of channel 
      logs won’t help the problem with the hierarchy.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="discord-friends">
    <h3 class="friends-list">Organizing the Online Friends List</h3>
  <p class="friends-list-content">
    The online tab shows all the user’s friends that are currently 
    on the app regardless of their appearance status. Next, is the “all” 
    tab that shows a full list of a user’s friends, both online and 
    offline. Finally, the “pending,” “blocked” and “add a friend” tabs 
    are self-explanatory.
    <br><br>
    I asked four Discord users on what tab on the friends list they 
    are usually on and they responded with the “online” tab. I took 
    that into account to see what solution I could develop to help 
    organize the friends list.
  </p>

  <img class="friends-list-img" src="Discord/discord-friends.png">

  <p class="friends-list-img-content">
    Looking at the current design of the “online” friends, it indicates 
    a list of all current friends in alphabetical order according to 
    the current username. In addition, you can see that each friend 
    has their current activity shown. I had an idea to create categories 
    to show which friends were streaming, in-game and online. I believed 
    that organizing the list in three categories could help the user see 
    what specific activities their friends are engaged in without 
    scrolling through a long list.
    </p>

<div class="discord-ideations">
  <h1 class="discord-ideation-head">Ideating a Solution</h1>
  <p class="discord-ideation-content">
    After developing my ideas from the research, I began 
    sketching out solutions to the typography and hierarchy.
  </p>

<div class="discord-solution">
  <h1 class="discord-ideation-head">Adding my Touches to Discord</h1>
  <p class="discord-ideation-content">
    After sketching I began tweaking the typography of the server channels.
  </p>

  <h3 class="server-solution-head">Server Channel Changes</h3>
  <img class="server-solutions" src="Discord/server-channels.png">
  <p class="server-solution-content">
    I wanted to add contrast with the channel headers and its contents. 
    Channel headers were set to 36 pt size, bold and an off-white color. 
    For the channels, the text was set to 32 pt size, regular and a 
    darker gray. Finally, channels that have activity would be set to 
    bold and pure white. By doing this, the hierarchy would follow:
    <br><br>
    • First - channel headers<br><br>
    • Second - active channels<br><br>
    • Third - inactive channels<br><br>
  </p>

  <div class="friends-list-solution">
    <h3 class="friends-list-head">Online Friends List Changes</h3>
    <img class="discord-friends-solution-img" src="Discord/discord-friends-solution.png">
    <p class="friends-solution-content">
      Instead of scrolling through a long list of your friends and what they are 
      doing, I believe that categorizing online friends based on specific 
      activities would be beneficial to the user by giving the eyes more 
      breathing room and organization.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="discord-validation">
  <h1 class="discord-validation-head">User Validation</h1>
  <p class="discord-validation-content">
    After I applied the changes, I had four Discord users compare 
    the original design and my tweaks. Thankfully, all four users 
    liked my concept and would want to see it applied to the app.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="discord-reflection">
  <h1 class="discord-reflection-head">Reflections</h1>
  <p class="discord-reflection-content">
    Before I did this study, I've always thought that the server channels were
    cluttered and the friends list could be more organized. After sitting down 
    and studying Discord, I put my own design taste to clean up these features.
