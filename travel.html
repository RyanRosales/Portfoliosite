  <h1 class="travel-intro-head">Defining the Problem</h1>
  <p class="travel-intro-content">
    Traveling in a group can be a joyous time filled with wonderful 
    memories among group members. However, traveling in a group can 
    also be a daunting task as conflict can quickly cause group members 
    to butt heads. I realized that I experienced this issue in the past 
    with a group outing. A social gathering that began with a group of 
    friends ended in a group with severed ties. Seeing this as a social 
    issue, I wanted to know if other social groups experienced this as 
    well. Through research, I learned that miscommunication and conflict 
    among group trips is a common issue and there are even guides on 
    “How to stay sane when traveling in a group.”
    <br><br>
    I am someone who cherishes the relationships that I make, so I 
    wanted to develop a design solution that would improve the group 
    traveling experience.

    vehicles or airlines as a means for transportation. So I felt 18+ 
    years old as the target age demographic was the most fitting.

<div class="travel-research-intro">

    I researched group travel planning and the results were various 
    guides that gave insight on <b>“how to efficiently plan trips,”</b> along 
    with negative keywords, such as <b>“without losing friends.”</b>
    <br><br>
    Here are links to some of the guides that I have found:

    <div class="travel-interview">
      <p>
      After defining what the problem is, I conducted 10 to 15 minute interviews 
    with a few friends asking them to explain their last group trip and possible 
    issues that were involved.

<div class="travel-results-intro">
  <h1 class="travel-results-head">Research Results</h1>
  <p class="travel-results-content">
    • Group trips usually begin with one person doing all the planning. 
    Sometimes another person will help.
    <br><br>
    • Most party members tend to rely on one person to do all the 
    planning and do not contribute.
    <br><br>
    • Miscommunication was a major factor that sparked 
    conflict among group members.
    <br><br>
    • Groups set up a time and place to plan the trip.
    <br><br>
    • Members tend to split off from the group to partake in 
    their own activities and interests.

<div class="travel-pain-intro">
  <h1 class="travel-pain-head">Identifying the Pain Points</h1>
  <h3 class="travel-pain-subhead">Pain Point #1: Communication</h3>
  <p class="travel-pain-content">
    Communication is the biggest issue in group travel. From the research, 
    miscommunication tends to happen during the “planning” phase, but can 
    still happen at anytime during the duration of the trip. For whatever 
    reason, a member may refrain from speaking up about matters that they 
    are uncomfortable with to the group.
    <br><br>
    <h3 class="travel-pain2-subhead">Pain Point #2: Group Scheduling</h3>
    <p class="travel-pain2-content">
      A common method groups do to plan out their trips is having all 
      participants meet at a specified time and place in order to discuss 
      their trip. However, the problem here is that:
      <br><br>
      1. All members must find time to fit this discussion into their schedules
      <br><br>
      2. The discussion tends to be pushed back onto a later time and date 
      because not all members cannot meet.
      <br><br>
      Whether the group discussion is at a dinner or in an online call, 
      members must set time to meet. Instead, I believe a faster approach 
      is for one person to create a group through an app that sends text 
      messages to participants to join.
      <br><br>
      This method allows participants to:
      <br><br>
      1. Join the group trip at the click of a button. 
      <br><br>
      2. Respond to the text at their leisure.
      <br><br>
      3. Immediately see all information about the group’s trip after confirmation
    </p>

    <h3 class="travel-pain3-subhead">Pain Point #3: Accommodating Interests</h3>
    <p class="travel-pain3-content">
      The third issue is accommodating every member’s travel interests. 
      Each member has their own interests and nobody will come home happy 
      if they were unable to accomplish what they wanted to do on the trip. 
      To create a better experience, group participants should have the freedom 
      to add activities at their own time that notifies the rest of the group 
      on who is going, what the activity is, when is it and where is it.
    </p>

<div class="travel-persona-intro">
  <h1 class="travel-persona-head">Creating a Persona</h1>
  <p class="travel-persona-content">
    I previously did not have a persona for this project. My 
    initial designs would lose its flow because I did not have a 
    specific audience in mind. I developed this persona based on the 
    data from my interviews.

<div class="travel-solution1-intro">
  <h1 class="travel-solution1-head">Design Solutions</h1>
  <h3 class="travel-solution1-subhead">Experience #1: Trip Information</h3>
  <p class="travel-solution1-content">
    Once an account is created, the user is prompted to fill out a form 
    that will create their trip page. This screen is my solution to the 
    “Who, What, When and Where?” question.
  </p>

  <img class="travel-solution1" src="travel/experience1.jpg">

  <p class="travel-solution1-content2">
    This was my solution to Pain Point #2 where the host user can 
    create a page from the app and select their friends’ numbers to 
    be added to the trip. This saves time because the group participants 
    no longer have to set a time and date to meet and can simply respond 
    to the text message at their leisure.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="travel-solution2-intro">
  <h3 class="travel-solution2-subhead">Experience #2: Homepage</h3>
  <p class="travel-solution2-content">
    After creating their first trip page, the user will be taken to the 
    homepage where they will see an overview of their upcoming trip. 
    In addition, the user has the freedom to create more trip pages and 
    any page additions will be placed under the “Planned Trips” section 
    below the “Upcoming Trips.”
    <br><br>
    Since I am limiting the UI of each screen, in theory the homepage 
    could potentially have more features, such as food and local event 
    recommendations.
  </p>

  <img class="travel-solution2" src="travel/Homepage.jpg">

  <p class="travel-solution2-content2">
    If the user clicks on any of the “Trip” tabs, they will be taken to 
    another page that details all the information specific to that trip. 
    From here, they can see the Google maps location of their 
    destination, when the trip will take place and who is going.
  </p>

  <img class="travel-solution3" src="travel/Trip Overview.jpg">

  <p class="travel-solution2-content3">
    I added a custom activity feature for the participants of that trip. 
    This solves Pain Point #3 because each participant can create an 
    activity that accommodates to their own plans and interests. 
    All group members will be able to see who is going to each activity, what 
    activities were added, when and where each activity will take place. 
    As a bonus, if a user clicks on an active activity, they will be given 
    an option to join it.

<div class="travel-experience3-intro">
  <h3 class="travel-experience3-subhead">Experience #3: Messaging</h3>
  <p class="travel-experience3-content">
    I believed a built-in messaging system for a trip planning app is 
    very helpful in solving communications issues. Since I mentioned in 
    Pain Point #1 that communication was a major issue, a built-in messaging 
    system helps save time from using another messaging app and much more 
    convenient since it would be one click away. This would allow participants 
    to notify each other quickly for upcoming events or last minute schedule 
    changes.

</div>

<div class="travel-experience4-intro">
  <h3 class="travel-experience4-subhead">Experience #4: Notifications</h3>
  <p class="travel-experience4-content">
    Since the functionality of this trip app involves adding and removing 
    different features, a messaging system and activity notifications, it 
    would be beneficial for the user if they were notified of frequent 
    changes so they do not miss out on opportunities or important messages.
