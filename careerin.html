        <h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
        <h2>I particpated in a hackathon and collaborated with a cross-functional team of four UX Designers and two developers. We had the opportunity 
            to learn about Careerin, a new tech startup, who's vision is to make job searching easier and connect rising talent to the right recruiters.
        </h2>
        <h2><b>The Problem</b></h2>
        <h2><b>• More and more people are transitioning into the tech industry and landing a job is getting more difficult.
            How can Careerin help job seekers stand out in the market and find more interviews and job offers?</b>
        </h2>
        <h2><b>Project Constraints</b></h2>
        <h2>• We were expected to present an end-to-end product design in a 3 week period.
            <br>
            • Participants with other priorities could only offer so much of their time to this event.
            <br>
            • The team I worked with experienced communication issues.
            <br>
            • Some participants resigned from the team in the middle and near the end of the hackathon.

        <h1>RESEARCH</h1>
        <h3>Careerin's founder, Kenneth Ip, has done tech recruitment for over 10 years and he developed this platform to help job seekers
            in tech expedite their search for work opportunities. He claimed that <b>recruiters can't "see" a candidate's personality</b> and 
            believes <b>personality is the main reason why many tech professionals struggle to find work, even with a polished resume</b>.
            <br><br>
            His vision for Careerin is for users to create their own profiles that show who they are outside of their professions and allow 1:1 engagement with recruiters.

        <p>Interview with Kenneth Ip.</p>

        <br>
        <h3><b>Research Findings</b></h3>
        <h3>We conducted <b>four interviews and a Google survey to reach a wider audience</b>. Feedback from our responders revealed <b>55.3% saw value in showing
            personality</b>, but felt <b>it can't make up for their lack of work experience</b>.

        <br>
        <h3>After we presented our findings to Kenneth, we worked with him to <b>re-design the current sign-up process on the Careerin website</b>.</h3>
        <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Careerin/Research/Careerin-userflow.png">
        <p>When users sign up, they are brought to a messaging page that prompts them to connect with Kenneth.</p>

        <h1>DISCONNECTIONS</h1>
        <h3>After we structured a new user flow, we decided to split the design work evenly. However, members one and two didn't correspond to the user flow and style guide we all agreed on.
            As a result, we had to restart at the beginning with only a few days left of the hackathon. Unfortunately, they stopped communicating with the rest of the team and 
            formed their own group to close out their portion of the work.

<!--Resolving Team Problems-->
<section class="content">
    <div class="container">
        <h1>DESIGN REVISIONS</h1>
        <h3>Unhappy with the outcome of the product, another teammate and I reached out to a hackathon coordinator and explained our situation. He directed us to revise the product and contact the team members that left. 
            <br><br>We managed to get a hold of the two team members that left and convinced them to have a meeting with the coordinator as a team. He encouraged us to work 
            together again as a team and move forward in this new direction.

            event with only our names listed.
            Overall, <b>This hackathon leveled up my collaboration experience and other soft skills</b>. The results weren't ideal, but I resolved to remain composed and patient and tried encouraging my fellow teammates to stay together and focus
            on shipping out the product.
