      Overview
    </h1>
    <h3 class="text-area">
      <p>I took on a 30 day design project in order to hone my skills in UX. 
        Participants were given creative freedom so I decided to work on UI 
        interactions on Adobe After Effects. 
        <br>
        <br>
        My plan was to design specific UI themes in 10 day intervals. The first 
        5 days were practicing specific interactions in basic form and then the 
        remaining 5 days I advanced to full app screen interactions.

  <div class="process">

      Process
    </h1>
    <h3 class="text-area">
      <p>I researched various UI interactions to see what kind of animations I was 
        interested in and what I felt I could accomplish during the project. After the 
        research process, I compiled a list of themes I wanted to do for each 10 day intervals.
        I began sketching out how I wanted each animation to be. If I had time, I would plan out future
        animation ideas ahead of time, otherwise I would do the planning process the day of each animation.
        <br>
        <br>  
        When I felt satisfied with each idea, I worked on Adobe XD to develop the wireframes. If there were vector 
        illustrations involved, I would work on Adobe Illustrator first then import it to XD.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once the UI designs were completed, I imported them into Adobe After Effects. From here I would try to 
        limit my time on animating to 2-3 hours.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once satisfied with the result, I would export my animations as mp4 files and then 
        upload them onto Instagram.

      Reflections

    <h3 class="text-area">
      <p>I stayed true to the 30 day project and uploaded each day. 
        This project was indeed a challenge since I had to manage my time properly 
        each day. Overall, I enjoyed doing this project and I have gained so much 
        knowledge in After Effects and UI interactions.
        <br>
        <br>
        On a final note, I believe it's necessary for UX designers to understand 
        how interactions work, especially when collaborating with developers.
