  <div class="enter-synneko-body">Our goal for the Synneko IoT app was themed around a friendly AI who is 
    capable of understanding various human utterances and speech. This would eliminate voice commands,

    I was a Product Designer and along with a team of researchers and UX designers, we set

  <div class="analysis-head">UNDERSTANDING EXISTING SMART SPEAKER AND IOT DEVICES</div>
  <div class="analysis-body">Our first step was to expand our knowledge on smart speakers. We also researched various companies such as Google and Sonos to understand their design practices for
    IoT development. When we moved onto user interviews, we found a common problem among smart speaker users.</div>

<div class="container-problem">
  <div class="problem-head">WHAT ARE THE EXISTING PROBLEMS?</div>

  <div class="problem-body">
    We interviewed users across speaker brands such as Google and Amazon and
    <b>they expressed concern toward their privacy and interacting with the AI system. </b>
    Users were worried that the devices were passively “listening” to household conversations and collecting
    private information. In addition, voice AIs required very specific commands to function properly.

  <div class="solution-body">
    <b>An IoT onboarding experience that guarantees confidentiality of private information and an AI capable of engaging in casual human conversations.</b>
    <br><br>
    Adding a Terms and Policies into the onboarding would help the product gain trust from users by only collecting information to better improve future updates and devices and will not be sold to or utilized by any third-party.
    <br><br>
    Since the AI, IRIS (<b>I</b>ntelligent. <b>R</b>ad. <b>I</b>nteractive. <b>S</b>ystem.), can decipher various utterances and speech, this would not bind her to voice commands, 
    resulting in a conversational and responsive virtual best friend.

    After we spent some time developing an optimal onboarding experience, we tested our theory and here are the results from our users.

    <b>5/5 - Liked the in-depth registration and device setup process.

      3/5 - Found some steps as “filler” and did not contribute to the process.

      Within the onboarding experience, users will encounter two features that would guarantee the safety of their private information:
      <b>Smart ID and Terms and Policies</b>. 
      <br><br>
      <b>Smart ID</b> enables users to log-in to the app via their voice; which would help eliminate identity theft.
      <br><br>
      Our <b>Terms and Policies</b> clearly states that information and data would be stored in a proprietary cloud system, used only to 
      improve future devices, and would not be leaked to any third-party.

      Overall, I learned that disconnections happen often as it disrupted the team's workflow and we had to reassess in the beginning.
      However, we recovered quickly and I took the opportunity to learn about my team's strengths and weaknesses and offered to assist various tasks to expedite the workflow.
