    users' private information and a voice UI that encourages casual conversations between humans and AI. Your next best friend is an AI. Pretty dope right?</div>

  <div class="problem-body">
    Feedback we received from users across brands such as Google and Amazon,
    <b>expressed their concern toward their privacy and interactions with the AI systems. </b>
    They were worried that the devices were passively “listening” to household conversations and collecting
    private information. In addition, voice AIs require specific commands to function properly; which makes them incapable
    of answering vague requests.

  <div class="solution-body">
    <b>An IoT onboarding experience that guarantees confidentiality of private information and a voice UI that is capable of understanding various utterances and speech.</b>
    <br><br>
    We determined a Terms and Policies feature would solve the security problem. Users would gain trust with a product once they know their information is safe and won't be utilized by any third-party.
    To align with our user needs, we deduced that text displays in the voice UI should appear less robotic, and more casual.

    After we spent some time developing an optimal onboarding experience, we tested our theory and here are the results from our testers.

    <b>5/5 - Liked the onboarding process and how it tells users that private information remains confidential. In addition, we received positive
      feedback when our testers read through a prototype conversation between a human and the AI.

    <div class="design-solution-body">
      Within the onboarding experience, users will encounter two features that would guarantee the safety of their private information:
      <b>Smart ID and Terms and Policies</b>. 
      <br><br>
      <b>Smart ID</b> enables users to log-in to the app via their voice; which would help eliminate identity theft.
      <br><br>
      Our <b>Terms and Policies</b> was structured around a proprietary cloud system and information would only be used
      to improve future devices, and would not be leaked to any third-party.

      We kept in mind to design the voice UI to "understand" various utterances and speech. We created a scenario where a user
      speaks to the AI as if it were another human, and the AI gives a human-like response.

    <div class="thoughts-body">
      Overall, I learned that disconnections happen often as it disrupted the team's workflow and we had to reassess in the beginning.
      However, we recovered quickly and I took the opportunity to learn about my team's strengths and weaknesses and offered to assist various tasks to expedite the workflow.
