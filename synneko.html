  <div class="problem-head">WHAT ARE THE EXISTING PROBLEMS?</div>

  <div class="problem-body">
    We interviewed 5 people who use smart speaker brands from Google, Amazon and Apple and
    <b>they expressed concern toward their privacy and the AI command system. </b>
    <br><br>
    Users were worried that the devices were passively “listening” to household conversations and collecting
    private information. In addition, voice AIs required very specific commands to function properly.

  <div class="solution-body">
    <b>An onboarding experience which guarantees confidentiality of private information and a humanized AI.</b>
    <br><br>
    This in-depth process would allow users to gain trust towards the Synneko brand. 
    <br><br>Our Terms and Policies state that information will only be collected to improve future updates, devices, and will not be sold to or utilized by any third-party.
    <br><br>
    The AI, IRIS (<b>I</b>ntelligent. <b>R</b>ad. <b>I</b>nteractive. <b>S</b>ystem.), would be humanized by understanding various utterances and speech. This would not bind her to voice commands, 
    resulting in a conversational and responsive virtual best friend.

      Within the onboarding experience, users will encounter two features that would guarantee the safety of their private information:
      <b>Smart ID and Terms and Policies</b>. 
      <br><br>
      <b>Smart ID</b> enables users to log-in to the app via their voice; which would help eliminate identity theft.
      <br><br>
      Our <b>Terms and Policies</b> clearly states that information and data would be stored in a proprietary cloud system, used only to 
      improve future devices, and would not be leaked to any third-party.

      Overall, I learned:
      <br><br>
      Remain transparent with the product team and stakeholders as disconnects happen quite often. 
      Thankfully, we recovered quickly and it did not hinder our schedule.
