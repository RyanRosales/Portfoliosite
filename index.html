            <h1>The creative mind behind the screen.</h1>
            <h3>I'm a Product Designer who strives to make technology easier to use.</h3>
            <h3>I believe the high-quality design work I produce comes from my Graphic Design background and my desire to learn new things. 
                In addition, I taught myself front-end development to understand design constraints when it's translated into code. </h3>
            <h3>My ability to wear many hats, plus my desire to work with awesome people, would allow me to fit perfectly in fast-paced, optimistic startups and established product teams.</h3>
            <h3>There's so much I don't know so I'm keeping an open mind and continually improving my craft.</h3>
            <h3>Finally, on my spare time, I‚Äôm learning UX Design for AR and VR. Along with my passion for these technologies, I've begun learning game design, 
                3D design, Unity, and C# programming.</h3>

            <h1>Kind words</h1>
        </div>
            <h3><i>"Ryan designed my portfolio website, and I could not have been happier with how everything turned out.
                Out of 200+ designers reached out to me on the project, Ryan and his work immediately stood out. I had no 
                idea that he was still so early in his career, as his work and his professionalism are far beyond his age.
                </i></h3>
            <h3><i>Ryan was prompt, creative, and very flexible with all of my ideas--even the incoherent ones I couldn't 
                communicate well. As a backend developer, I was unsure of how to show off my enterprise coding projects;
                Ryan had the great idea to write up case studies about each one as a substitute for revealing proprietary
                source code.</i></h3>
                <h3><i>I would recommend Ryan to anyone in need of UI/UX design work. He would make a fantastic addition to any team,
                    and I look forward to seeing his career unfold (and reaching out to him when I want to redesign my site!)."</i></h3>

            <br>

            <h3><i>"Ryan was an excellent addition to our team. He brought fresh ideas and tools to solve issues we were facing. 
                He was eager to grow and learn and, during his time on our team, took on more and more responsibility as we threw 
                more and more projects to him.</i></h3>
            <h3><i>Alongside that, he was a great personality to have around and fit right in well with our culture. It was great 
                working with him and I hope together someday we can make beautiful designs again."</i></h3>
