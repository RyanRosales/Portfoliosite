  <div class="enter-ocular">ENTER OCULAR</div>
  <div class="enter-ocular-body">Ocular is a concept Mixed Reality smart headset that is designed to assist and expedite 
    the work process of registered nurses. Enabling them to dedicate more time to a patient's physical needs without 
    having difficulty completing their technical responsibilities.</div>
</div>

<div class="ocular-project-reason">
  <div class="ocular-project-reason-head">WHY I DID THIS PROJECT</div>
  <div class="ocular-project-reason-body">This project marks the beginning of a new chapter in my career as an 
    experience designer. My limited exposure to Extended Reality (AR/MR/VR) was originally for entertainment, 
    but I finally made the decision to transfer my skills to pursue the next possibilities. 
  <br><br>
  My second reason for doing this project was to help create a solution for registered nurses. I come from a Filipino background, 
  who are known to pursue the medical field, specifically nursing. Hearing my mother and family friends talk about the physical 
  and mental stress they get from work, drove me to the decision to help revolutionize healthcare and the way people live.
  <br><br>
  While this concept project goes beyond what current technology can do, it helps visualize what technology could become.

<div class="ocular-limit">
  <div class="ocular-limit-head">PROJECT LIMITATIONS</div>
  <div class="ocular-limit-body">Due to safety, I couldn't visit a hospital to simulate all of my original solutions at my own leisure. 
    Final designs were enacted outside of medical environments; preventing some solutions from being featured in this study.
  <br><br>
  As much as I would want all concepts related to this project to see the light of day, I’m not well-versed in 2D/3D modeling to develop the device.

  <div class="ocular-research-head">UNDERSTANDING CONSTRAINTS IN  EXTENDED REALITY</div>
  <div class="ocular-research-body">XR still in its infancy with current technology 
    taking a bulky structure to house hardware. However, as technology progresses, XR devices will 
    definitely take smaller sizes.
  <br><br>
  On multiple occasions, I had to step back and reevaluate the technological constraints when it 
  came time for the design stage instead of succumbing to my own creativity. Whether designing 
  for a real product or a concept, the user experience and functionality should never be forgotten.

<div class="ocular-user-research">
  <div class="ocular-user-research-head">USER RESEARCH</div>
  <div class="ocular-user-research-body">I conducted a survey from <b>13 Registered Nurses who have been 
    in the field for at least 25 years</b> with <b>61.5% who are over the age of 50.</b>
  <br><br>
  A clear look at the age gap between young nurses and aging veterans, I deeply thought about the UX and accessibility.

    <br><br>
    Day Coordinator assigns night shift nurses to at least 5 patients. However, the amount may vary depending on the current situation. 
    <br><br>
    1. Nurses check paper assignments at nurse stations.
    <br><br>
    2. Short meeting of all nurses with floor coordinator.
    <br><br>
    3. Review patient list and report to corresponding day nurse.
    <br><br>
    4. Attend to patients.
    <br><br>
    5. Perform head-to-toe assessments.
    <br><br>
    Assessments include vital checks, ordering medicine, administering medicine and maintaing doctor's orders.
    <br><br>
    6. Return to desk and chart patient conditions.

    <div class="ocular-problem">
      <div class="ocular-problem-head">PATIENT CHARTING</div>
      <div class="ocular-problem-body">From my survey, responders addressed the difficulties of documenting patient information.
      During head-to-toe assessments, nurses write down any unusual conditions on paper, but <b>usually rely on memory to document the rest of the assessments onto computer.</b>
        <br><br>
        This results in cognitive overload as nurses try to remember important information while multi-tasking in an ever-changing environment. Accurate and 
        detailed charting is critical for nurses and the well-being of patients. Nursing records are the only proof that protects nurses from legal actions if 
        claims are brought against them.
        <br><br>
        <b>By law in many countries, if it wasn't recorded, it never happened.</b>

        <b>Improving Work Efficiency</b>
        <br><br>
        • Through research, AR became the most optimal technological solution for this case scenario. 
        It can create a faster and more efficient work environment for nurses with many options that can 
        improve workflow, such as voice and eye-tracking. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Accessbility</b>
        <br><br>
        • Current accessibility options opens personalization in many smart devices such as the Apple iPhone. However, XR devices could elevate the experience of accessibility. 
        Wouldn't it be cool to have a device that can zoom into distant objects by "pinching" the location?

        This project was definitely a challenge to stay motivated with. Diving into a 
        technology that is still in its infancy, along with so many unknowns, made me feel like an imposter. 
        <br><br>
        For future XR projects, I will invest in equipment and programs, such as the Oculus and Unity, to properly 
        develop prototypes. I am filled with excitement to learn more about XR and put all that knowledge into practice. 
        The next step is to start grinding in my virtual office.
