  <p class="client-overview-content">
    I took on a Freelance project mid March, 2020 where I worked on designing a 
    Full-Stack Developer's Portfolio Wesbite. My client, Derek, and I set up a phone
    call to get to know each other and discuss the scope of work. I took the time to 
    understand his personality and his goal for the project. He addressed that he wanted to create a 
    portfolio to showcase his previous work as a Backend Developer and his Front-end development skills. 
    In addition, he wanted his about page to share his life and hobbies, such as travel pictures and a feature that shares his Spotify playlists.
    After our phone call, we both signed a contract to settle our agreements for the project.
    <br><br>
    For the next two weeks, I worked on Derek's portfolio, frequently updating him on 
    my progress on the project. I would apply the feedback he gave me after each iteration
    before the deadline. Once the deadline came along, he filled out the invoice and I sent him
    all the files stated in the contract.
    <br><br> 
    It was a great pleasure working with Derek and I had a lot of fun, especially designing his about page. 
    This was a new space for me to work in as it gave me the opportunity to challenge myself as a creative because I had to design features that reflected 
    Derek's life and personality, based on my understanding of who he is as a person. Finally, he was gracious to connect me with a design 
    studio in the Seattle area.

<div class="review">
  <i class="derek-text">
    "Ryan designed my portfolio website, and I could not have been happier with how everything turned out. 
    Out of 200+ designers reached out to me on the project, Ryan and his work immediately stood out. 
    I had no idea that he was still so early in his career, as his work and his professionalism are far 
    beyond his age.
    <br><br>
    Ryan was prompt, creative, and very flexible with all of my ideas--even the incoherent ones I couldn't 
    communicate well. As a backend developer, I was unsure of how to show off my enterprise coding projects; 
    Ryan had the great idea to write up case studies about each one as a substitute for revealing proprietary 
    source code.
    <br><br>
    I would recommend Ryan to anyone in need of UI/UX design work. He would make a fantastic addition to any team, and I look forward to seeing his career 
    unfold (and reaching out to him when I want to redesign my site!)."
