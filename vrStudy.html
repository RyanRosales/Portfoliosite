  <div class="vrstudy-research-body">
    I spent the past few months studying VR Design practices. From UX/UI, game development, architecture, refreshing my graphic design skills,
    3D modeling and so on. A large part of my learnings derived from Google's VR design guidelines. Their presentations taught 
    me how to approach the design process and apply UX/UI Design and angular units for scalable content sizes.
    <br><br>
    In addition, I found great value in Mike Alger's research on user interface design for digital dyewear and ergonomics, along with Alex Chu's 
    research on VR experiences and comfort zones. Lastly, Oculus's Developer documentations is another great resource for learning current best design
    practices for VR and Mixed Reality.

  <div class="vrstudy-hierarchy-body">
    In Alger's research on digital eyewear, he studied how people navigate in virtual 3D spaces. He observed people's head movements when they serached 
    for objects without context. These are his findings:
    <br><br>
    • 1. Look at what's in front of them.
    <br><br>
    • 2. Look to the sides.
    <br><br>
    • 3. Look at what's below them.
    <br><br>
    • 4. Look at what's above them.
    <br><br>
    • 5. Finally, what's located on their body.

<div class="vrstudy-comfort">
  <div class="vrstudy-comfort-head">COMFORT ZONES</div>
  <div class="vrstudy-comfort-body">
    Chu's and Alger's reserach on comfort zones explains the degrees of comfort and discomfort for head rotations, assuming
    a person is stationary, such as sitting on a couch.
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    The small space around the user is the <b>No-no Zone</b>. This area is less than 0.5 meters (19.7 inches or 1.64 feet)
    away from the user. According to Alger, content should not be placed here permanently as the short distance will cause 
    double vision and discomfort. The <b>Main Content Zone</b> ranges from 0.5 meters to 20 meters ahead of the user 
    and contains a total of 94° of comfortable viewing range and content legibility.
    <br><br>
    If a person turns their head between 77° and 102°, they enter the <b>Peripheral Zone</b>. 77° is still in comfort range, but once a person's head reaches 102°,
    they will experience neck strain. Beyond 102° is the <b>Curiousity Zone</b>. People must physically turn their bodies to view content that's behind them.

<div class="vrstudy-units">
  <div class="vrstudy-units-head">ANGULAR UNITS</div>
  <div class="vrstudy-units-body">
    Once I understood how to apply the comfort zones, I wanted to learn current UI Design and Typography practices. I studied Google's use of angular
    units to measure content in VR. With angular units, UI and Typography will remain consistent across all screen sizes.
  </div>

  <div class="vrstudy-units-img">

  </div>

  <br><br>

  <div class="vrstudy-units-body2">
    In this example, Google's Chris McKenzie explained how there's a significant size difference between the letter A on the smartphone and the billboard.
    However, if aligned side-by-side, the size looks about the same. This method is powerful because designers <b>only need to design layouts once and it will
      remain legible no matter the screen size and how far away it is</b>.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="vrstudy-dmm">
  <div class="vrstudy-dmm-head">DMM: DISTANCE-INDEPENDENT MILLIMETER</div>
  <div class="vrstudy-dmm-body">
    So why did Google choose Dmms? A Dmm is an angular unit that's measured at <b>1 millimeter viewed as 1 meter away</b>.
    To achieve 1 Dmm in Unity, designers must create a UI canvas, set it to "World Space," and then scale it down by a 1000%.
    <br><br>
    <div class="vrstudy-dmm-setup-img">
      <img class="dmm-setup-img" src="VRStudy/in-game/VR study images/dmm-setup.jpg">
      <div class="vrstudy-dmm-caption">
        Screenshot of the Dmm setup in my Unity Inspector.
      </div>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    Now that the canvas is scaled down, designers can translate their UI designs from pixels to Dmms. For instance, if a button from Figma had a height of 50px, a width of 100px
    and text at 24px, they simply scale 50 x 100 dmms for the button and 24 dmms for the text in Unity.

<div class="vrstudy-type">
  <div class="vrstudy-type-head">TYPOGRAPHY</div>
  <div class="vrstudy-type-body">
    Now that I have a strong grasp on scaling UI and setting type sizes, I was curious to see how various fonts functioned in VR.
    I experimented font combinations, visual appeal, and legibility at <b>2.5 meters (8.2ft) away from the main camera</b>. Through my observations, 
    text remains crisp and legible no matter the distance thanks to the TextMesh Pro feature in Uniy. 
    <br><br>
    Overall, I find sans serif fonts to be more legibile than serif fonts since it's more legibile at farther distances. 
    However, there may be a way to naturally incorporate both as VR technology progresses.

        I've learned so much these past few months and it's so exciting to put my knowledge into practice. For the future of this project, 
        I plan on iterating and adding more UX/UI content as I continue to learn and gain more experience in VR Design.
