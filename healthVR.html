          mother who recently retired from nursing. 
        </h3>
        <h3>I went through an extensive UX design process, challenging myself and gaining
          new skills in 3D modeling and programming to design this immersive experience.

    <h4>RESEARCH</h4>
    <h1>Synthesizing secondary and primary research</h1>
    <h3>I conducted extensive research to understand why the healthcare system is failing and to prove Virtual Reality 
      is the answer that the medical field needs to improve the education and training of medical 
      professionals, and ultimately, save more lives.
    </h3>

    <h2>Main insights</h2>
    <h3><b>The nursing shortage is a result of problems within the education system.</b></h3>
    <h3>• More and more qualified nursing applicants are getting rejected due to a lack of educational staff. What I found is veteran nurses 
      will have a significant pay cut if they become teachers.</h3>
    <h3>• With a short amount of people willing to teach the next generation, there are more undergraduates who can't enter the field and hospitals are losing more workers. </h3>

    <h3><b>Medical errors are a leading factor of patient deaths.</b></h3>
    <h3>• According to a John Hopkins study in 2016, "More than 250,000 deaths per year are due to medical error in the U.S."</h3>
    <h3>• Interview participants addressed how their training isn't realistic using dummies and as a result, they don't learn anything valuable.</h3>
    <h3>• An interview participant mentioned they were told "they'll learn on the job," but it scared them because they don't want to see their patients suffer.</h3>

    <h3><b>Interview participants addressed a lack of training of basic procedures.</b></h3>
    <h3>• Participants from ages 25 to 60+ years wished they had more training in Head-to-toe assessments, IV and SubQ (subcutaneous) injections.</h3>

    <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
    <h3>I researched direct competitors on how they approached this ongoing problem using Virtual Reality.</h3>

    <h4>USERFLOW</h4>
    <h1>Ideating the experience</h1>
    <h3>Now, it was time to begin building my experience. Initially, crafting the userflow took many paths, 
      but to maintain accessibility and usability, I structured it off these two concepts:
    <br><br>
    • Teach users how to use VR through simple and interactive instructions.
    <br><br>
    • Guide users to reach the main content as soon as possible.

<!--Prototype & test-->
<section class="content">
  <div class="container">
    <h4>PROTOTYPE & TEST</h4>
    <h1>Assembling the 3D environment and spatial UI</h1>
    <h3>During the design phase, I found rapid prototyping easier to achieve since Blender natively works in Unity. 
      I originally thought building the experience would take a while due to my inexperience with VR. 
      <br><br>
      To my surprise, I saved a week's worth of time because any changes I made in Blender were automatically updated in Unity.
      Also, designing the UI in Figma and building it in Unity proved to be less-time consuming.</h3>

    <br><br>
    <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Healthcare_VR/3D & UI pics/Patient model.png">
    <br>
    <h3>• To make the scene more realistic, I imported a pre-made 3D patient model from Sketchfab.</h3>

    <br><br>
    <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Healthcare_VR/3D & UI pics/patient_room_iteration2.png">
    <br>
    <h3>• At this stage of modeling, I tested my scene to find size adjustments were needed, followed by creating more assets to make a convincing environment.</h3>

    <h2>Onboarding</h2>
    <h3>The onboarding was the most important part of the experience. My ideal approach was to create a completely interactive experience 
      with visual cues and a AI that would transition each scene after certain tasks were completed. 
      <br><br>
      However, that was beyond my current programming capabilities, so I developed an alternative solution that worked just as great.</h3>
    <h3>I created two versions of the onboarding that I had users test. Both versions had instructions in the form of images and text, but the first version involved 
      picking up various medical equipment, while the second version had users play with cubes. 
      <br><br>
      Surprisingly, the latter gained more favor from my testers, claiming it was “more fun” than picking up medical equipment.</h3>

    <h2>Main Menu</h2>
    <h3>After the onboarding, users can choose from a list of scenarios they can practice on. I featured the three 
      responsibilties mentioned from my interviews with each scenario having the option to begin its corresponding tutorial or examination.</h3>

    <br><br>
    <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Healthcare_VR/3D & UI pics/Exam.png">
    <br>
    <h2>Examination</h2>
    <h3>Finally, the examination was essential to test a user’s skills by removing the step-by-step tutorial function; leaving them in a realistic scenario where they must train their 
      minds to think critically and quickly. Of course, if they wish to leave the simulation at any time, there is an ever-present exit menu found within their field of view.</h3>

    <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
    <h1>Reflection & Learnings</h1>
    <h3>This project was the result of spending the past few months learning Unity and Blender. My hunger for knowledge and my love for technology drove me to acquire new skills I 
      previously thought I wasn’t capable of achieving. In addition, building this experience with my current knowledge of VR design boosted my confidence and deepened my love for emerging technologies.</h3>
      <h3>My next steps is to continue expanding my UX/UI, 3D modeling and programming skills to explore the possibilities.</h3>
