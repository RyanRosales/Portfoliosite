        <h1>Designing the future of healthcare training</h1>
        <h3>I spent four weeks building a Virtual Reality experience, focused on healthcare training. 
          This project stemmed from the lifelong influence of my mother who recently retired from nursing. 
          I grew up listening to my mother‚Äôs efforts to provide the utmost, selfless care for her patients 
          and all of the hardships she went through over the last thirty years in the field.
        </h3>
        <h3>To express one of my dreams of contributing to the future of medicine through 
          AR/VR technology, I challenged myself by going through an extensive UX design process, as well as leveraging 
          new skills in 3D modeling and programming to design this immersive experience.

    <h4>DECISIONS & CONSTRAINTS</h4>
    <h1>Project scope</h1>
    <h3>In the beginning, before I considered entering the research phase, I planned out how I could accomplish this 
      project in four weeks. I considered the fact that I‚Äôm alone for the entire duration and I‚Äôm held responsible for 
      the entire design process.</h3>
      <h3>
        I limited the size of this project based on my current skills and knowledge by focusing on user experience design, as 
        well as leveraging new skills in 3D modeling and programming. By focusing on my specialties, I was able achieve the results 
        I expected within a four-week period.

    <h4>SECONDARY RESEARCH</h4>
    <h1>What is causing the U.S. healthcare system to fail?</h1>
    <h3>The project officially took off and I began my process with secondary research. I examined contributing factors towards the decline 
      of the system in the past few decades and what that spells for the years to come.</h3>
    <h2>Nursing schools continue to reject qualified students</h2>
    <h3>‚ÄúU.S. schools are being forced to turn away qualified applicants due to a lack of nursing educators available to teach,‚Äù 
      says Christina Morgan on her article ‚Äú<a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/nursing/nursing/72836" target="_blank" class="gradient-link"><b>Why Are Nursing Schools Rejecting Thousands of Applicants?</b></a>,‚Äù which was published on MedPageToday in 2018. 
    <br><br>
    A majority of healthcare nurses are nearing retirement and most don‚Äôt want to transition to teaching because of their advanced age and the huge salary difference. 
    With less educators and resources, there‚Äôs less opportunities for students to earn a nursing degree.
    </h3>

    </blockquote>

    <br><br>
    <h2>Nursing shortage</h2>
    <h3>Fewer graduating classes mean fewer young nurses breaking into the field. In a study by Registered Nursing in 2021, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.registerednursing.org/articles/nurse-education-contributing-nursing-shortage/" target="_blank" class="gradient-link"><b>Is Nursing Education Contributing to the Nursing Shortage?</b> </a>,‚Äù 
      the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) says ‚Äúone major contribution to the nursing shortage is that there are simply not enough nursing instructors, clinical sites, and classroom space for those wishing to enter the profession.‚Äù
    <br><br>
    But that‚Äôs not all, if these problems persist, the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI) predicts a ‚Äúprojected shortage of 510,394 registered nurses nationwide by 2030.‚Äù
    </h3>

    <br><br>
    <h2>Medical errors</h2>
    <h3>The problem doesn't end at the nursing shortage. The flawed educational system is increasing the risk of medical errors because new nurses lack proper training to handle life and death situations. The system is to blame, not the workers.</h3>
    <br>
    <blockquote>

    </blockquote>
    <br>
    <h3>This report was published by John Hopkins Medicine in 2016. What‚Äôs scary is how high that number is today during a pandemic where medical students, who already lack sufficient training, 
      have their education expedited in hopes of meeting demand.</h3>

    <h4>PRIMARY RESEARCH</h4>
    <h1>Insight from registered nurses</h1>
    <h3>I closed out my secondary research and I moved onto gathering more information by conducting 1:1 interviews with 10 registered nurses.</h3>

    <h3>I achieved the most of my interviews by speaking to an entire generation of nursing professionals.</h3>

    <h3>In my interviews I found an urgent need for new training methods and equipment. Recent graduates addressed how difficult it is to apply what

      Even after orientation, I still find myself in situations where I freeze up and don't know what do for my patients when they suddenly become critical. 
      But like, I did learn what to do in school. My body just doesn't connect the book knowledge to the clinical application. They keep telling me that 
      ‚Äòit comes with experience,‚Äô but these can be very scary scenarios, and if I can't act quickly, my patients can suffer.

    <h4>PROTOTYPE & TEST</h4>
    <h1>Assembling the 3D environment and spatial UI</h1>
    <h3>During the design phase, I found rapid prototyping easier to achieve since Blender natively works in Unity. 
      I originally thought building the experience would take a while due to my inexperience with VR. 
      To my surprise, I <b>saved a week's worth of time</b> because any changes I made in Blender were automatically updated in Unity.
      Also, designing the UI in Figma and building it in Unity proved to be less-time consuming.</h3>

    <h2>Onboarding</h2>
    <h3>The onboarding was the most important part of the experience. My ideal approach was to create a completely interactive experience 
      with visual cues and a AI that would transition each scene after certain tasks were completed. However, that was beyond my current
      programming capabilities, so I developed an alternative solution that worked just as great.</h3>
    <h3>I created two versions of the onboarding that I had users test. Both versions had instructions in the form of images and text, but the first version involved 
      picking up various medical equipment, while the second version had users play with cubes. Surprisingly, the latter gained more favor from my testers, 
      claiming it was ‚Äúmore fun‚Äù than picking up medical equipment.</h3>
