<div class="container-esports-overview">
  <div class="esports-overview-head">OVERVIEW</div>
  <div class="esports-overview-body">A design challenge I took on during 2018 that required original 
    design and content, along with handcrafting the final product. In addition, I was given the freedom to choose 
    any topic I wanted to cover. As an avid gamer, I wanted to cover the trending eSports culture and highlight 
    the environment gamers live in.

<div class="container-esports-story">
  <div class="esports-story-head">A LITTLE BACKGROUND STORY</div>
  <div class="esports-story-body">During the process of designing the layout of the magazine, I struggled because I was still 
    understanding Graphic Design and had no prior knowledge of magazine design. As I kept working on the layout and researching 
    more about design, my mentor saw my slow improvements.
    <br><br>
    I experimented with Typography and incorporated a grid system for text-heavy pages. In addition, my mentor had a strong liking 
    towards bold and blown up type. His infatuation rubbed off on me and I began incorporating blown up type to my designs.
    <br><br>
    This project was a turning point for my design career. During the duration of this project, I was experiencing severe imposter syndrome 
    and I felt that I was not fit to be in the design industry. Thankfully, my mentor at the time, saw my potential and he pushed my limits 
    as a designer. After producing the final product, I gained more confidence and developed the hunger to continue improving my craft.
