  <p class="esports-intro-content">
    A design challenge I took on during spring 2018 that required original 
    design and content, along with handcrafting the final product. In addition, 
    I was given the freedom to choose any topic I wanted to cover. As an avid 
    gamer, I wanted to cover the trending eSports culture and highlight the 
    environment gamers live in.

  <h1 class="esports-story-head">A Little Background Story</h1>
  <p class="esports-story-content">
    During the process of designing the layout of the magazine, 
    I struggled because I was still understanding Graphic Design had 
    no prior knowledge of magazine design. As I kept working on the layout 
    and researching more about design, my mentor saw my slow improvements.
    <br><br>
    I continued experimenting with Typography and incorporated a grid 
    system for text-heavy pages. In addition, my mentor had a strong liking 
    towards bold and blown up type. His infatuation rubbed off on me and I 
    began incorporating blown up type to my designs.
    <br><br>
    This project was a turning point for my design career. 
    During the time I was making this magazine, I was experiencing 
    severe imposter syndrome and I felt that I was not fit to be in 
    the design industry. Thankfully, my mentor at the time, saw my 
    potential and he pushed my limits as a designer. After producing 
    the final product, I gained more confidence and I developed the 
    hunger to continue improving my craft.
