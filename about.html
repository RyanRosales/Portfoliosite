      <p>I am currently attending my last semester at the California State 
        University, Fullerton. My expected graduation date is May 2020, with 
        a <b>Bachelor’s Degree in Graphic and Interactive Design.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        In October 2019, I interned for <b>Infinite Peripherals</b>, in Irvine California. 
        For the next three months, I worked under the marketing team with an emphasis 
        on web design. I was given responsibility for the design direction of  various 
        product pages and I worked closely with the development team to produce the 
        final results. In addition, I designed social media content for the company, 
        assisted the Creative Director with editing product motion graphics and the 
        development of UI screens for Infinite Peripherals’ NRF 2020 tradeshow.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am obsessed with my craft and I actively research and cultivate my design 
        skills daily. I try to make it a habit of thinking “UX” in my daily life and 
        I express it with any person I interact with. I believe this habit reflects 
        my desire  in creating meaningful relationships through the interactions I 
        come across.

        Two things that people will most likely learn about me is that I am 
        very enthusiastic about music and Japanese Anime. When I'm not tackling 
        a creative project, my hobbies include singing, cosplaying and gaming. 
        These hobbies of mine lets me really open up and be me.
