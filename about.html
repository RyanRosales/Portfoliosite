  <div class="ambition-head">MY UX CAREER GOALS</div>

  <div class="ambition-body">
    I think that no matter what design path I take, user-centered design will always align to my goals: help businesses leverage the experiences of users
    to shape the success of digital products.
    <br><br>
    Ever since I entered the UX industry, I followed the direction of web and mobile product design until I was captivated by Extended Reality (XR). Since I 
    enjoy gaming and anything related to the fantasy genre, I felt a connection in AR/VR/MR as it introduces the next-level of creativity that would allow people to visit 
    and experience other "worlds."
    <br><br>
    While I've tried out VR headsets and Pokemon Go in the past, I never truly saw the beauty of immersive experiences until 
    I recently bought myself an Oculus Rift S and actually sat down to fully experience a portion of XR. Honestly, I wish I 
    realized it sooner. Now, I'm looking for the next opportunity as a Product Designer to design immersive XR experiences 
    that could revolutionize healthcare, educational training, daily life and help create the first Full-Dive video game!

<div class="container-xr">
  <div class="xr-head">DIVING INTO XR</div>
  <div class="xr-body">
    After I bought an Oculus Rift S, my daily activities have shifted. I find 
    myself in what I call my "VR office," where I design no-code prototypes in VR tools such as Microsoft Maquette and Sketchbox 3D. 
    Since I'm actively learning more about XR, I've been attending webinars hosted by Unity and other XR groups that I find on Meetup.
    <br><br>
    Also, I'm currently expanding my XR knowledge and expertise in Unity and C#. As a side project, I'm learning how to develop a functional prototype VR game!

  <div class="vrchat-body">
    I wish I got into VRchat sooner. VRchat is a social game where users can meet other people around the world in virtual reality. I find this a great 
    way to socialize with other people while we are under this pandemic. So far, my experience has been great and I've met some cool people.

  <div class="game-head">FORMER COMPETITIVE GAMER WHO TURNED TO THE GACHA LIFE</div>
  <div class="game-body">
    I used to game hours upon hours, but after some time passed and I spent more of my time designing and setting my paths straight, I gradually played less and less. 
    When I began playing gacha games in 2017, I found it to be a stress reliever; where I can sit down and grind daily missions for 30 minutes to an 
    hour and then move onto something else. 
    <br><br> 
    Currently, my top 3 favorite gachas are Genshin Impact, Azur Lane and Arknights.

    I've been actively watching Anime ever since I was a kid and it still amazes me how I still keep this hobby today. 
    I've had my share of watching many Anime throughout the years, but the ones that I enjoy the most are 
    emotional stories that hit you in your "feels."
    <br><br> 
    I have a list of countless Anime that I consider my "favorites," but if I had to choose, my top 5 would be: 
    Angel Beats, Clannad, the Sword Art Online series, Your Name and Weathering With You.

  <div class="derek-review">
    <i>"Ryan designed my portfolio website, and I could not have been happier with how everything turned out. 
      Out of 200+ designers reached out to me on the project, Ryan and his work immediately stood out. I had no idea 
      that he was still so early in his career, as his work and his professionalism are far beyond his age.
      <br><br>
      Ryan was prompt, creative, and very flexible with all of my ideas--even the incoherent ones I couldn't communicate well. 
      As a backend developer, I was unsure of how to show off my enterprise coding projects; Ryan had the great idea to 
      write up case studies about each one as a substitute for revealing proprietary source code.
      <br><br>
      I would recommend Ryan to anyone in need of UI/UX design work. He would make a fantastic addition to any team, and I look 
      forward to seeing his career unfold (and reaching out to him when I want to redesign my site!)."
