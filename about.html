  <div class="ambition-head">MY UX CAREER GOALS</div>

  <div class="ambition-body">
    I think that no matter what design path I take, user-centered design will always align to my goals: help businesses leverage the experiences of users
    to shape the success of digital products.
    <br><br>
    Recently, I took great interest in Extended Reality (XR). As I learned more about these technologies and how it can positively improve the way people live, I became captivated.
    Since I'm a fan of anything related to the fantasy genre, I saw a connection between fantasy and AR/VR/MR as it introduces a level of immersion that would allow people to visit 
    and experience other "worlds."
    <br><br>
    While I've tried out VR headsets and Pokemon Go in the past, I never truly saw the beauty of immersive experiences until 
    I recently bought an Oculus Rift S and actually sat down to fully experience it. Honestly, I wish I 
    realized it sooner. Now, I'm looking for the next opportunity as a Product Designer to design immersive XR experiences 
    that could revolutionize healthcare, educational training, daily life and help create the first Full-Dive video game!

  <div class="xr-head">DIVING INTO XR</div>
  <div class="xr-body">
    After I bought an Oculus Rift S, my daily activities shifted. I find 
    myself in what I call my "VR office," where I design no-code prototypes in VR tools such as Microsoft Maquette and Sketchbox 3D. 
    Since I'm actively learning more about XR, I've been attending webinar events hosted by Unity and other XR groups that I find on Meetup.
    Also, I'm expanding my XR knowledge and expertise in Unity and C#. Currently, I'm learning how to develop my first functional AR and VR prototypes!

  <div class="vrchat-body">
    I wish I got into VRchat sooner. VRchat is a social game where users can meet other people around the world in virtual reality. I find this a great 
    alternative to in-person meetups. So far, my experience has been great and I've met some cool people.

  <div class="game-head">FORMER COMPETITIVE GAMER WHO TURNED TO THE GACHA LIFE</div>
  <div class="game-body">
    I used to be a hardcore gamer where I would spend hours playing video games, but after some time, I gradually played less and less. I still game, but I moved my interests towards RPG gacha games.
    When I began playing gachas in 2017, I found it to be a stress reliever whenever I needed a break from design projects. I would spend around 30 minutes to an hour grinding out 
    daily missions before going back to work.
    <br><br> 
    Currently, my top 3 favorite gachas are Genshin Impact, Azur Lane and Arknights.

    I've been an Anime enthusiast ever since I was a kid and it still amazes me how I still keep this hobby today. 
    I've had my share of watching many Anime throughout the years, but the ones that I enjoy the most are 
    emotional stories that hit you in your "feels."
    <br><br> 
    While I consider countless Anime as my "favorites," my top 5 would be: 
    Angel Beats, Clannad, the Sword Art Online series, Your Name and Weathering With You.

  <div class="derek-review">
    <i>"Ryan designed my portfolio website, and I could not have been happier with how everything turned out. 
      Out of 200+ designers reached out to me on the project, Ryan and his work immediately stood out. I had no idea 
      that he was still so early in his career, as his work and his professionalism are far beyond his age.
      <br><br>
      Ryan was prompt, creative, and very flexible with all of my ideas--even the incoherent ones I couldn't communicate well. 
      As a backend developer, I was unsure of how to show off my enterprise coding projects; Ryan had the great idea to 
      write up case studies about each one as a substitute for revealing proprietary source code.
      <br><br>
      I would recommend Ryan to anyone in need of UI/UX design work. He would make a fantastic addition to any team, and I look 
      forward to seeing his career unfold (and reaching out to him when I want to redesign my site!)."
