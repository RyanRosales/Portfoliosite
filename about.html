      <p>I am currently a student attending the California State University, Fullerton 
        with an expected graduation date of Spring 2020, with a <b>Bachelor’s Degree in Graphic and Interactive Design.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        From October 2019 to January 2020, I was a Visual Design intern for <b>Infinite Peripherals</b>, in Irvine, California. 
        I led the visual design directions for Infinite Peripheral's product pages and translated my designs 
        into coding language to achieve effective communication with the development team. In addition, I used 
        my skills in Graphic Design and Typography to produce social media and print content; as well as assisting 
        the Creative Director with the production of product motion graphics. Finally, I was given the opportunity 
        to participate in Infinite Peripheral's vsual marketing for NRF 2020.
        <br>
        <br>
        Working for Infinite Peripherals has granted me opportunities to grow my design skills and learn 
        business and marketing values. Overall, my hunger for knowledge and my desire to grow as an individual 
        allowed me to adapt in a high-pressure environment from completing multiple projects on a time crunch and 
        handling last-minute changes.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am obsessed with my craft and I actively research and cultivate my design 
        skills daily. I try to make it a habit of thinking “UX” in my daily life and 
        I express it with any person I interact with. I believe this habit reflects 
        my desire to create meaningful relationships from the interactions I 
        have with other people.

        Two things that people will most likely learn about me is that I am 
        very enthusiastic about music and Japanese Anime. When I'm not tackling 
        a creative project, my hobbies include singing, cosplaying and gaming. 
        These hobbies of mine lets me really open up and be me.
