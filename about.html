  <div class="derek-review">
    <i>"Ryan designed my portfolio website, and I could not have been happier with how everything turned out. 
      Out of 200+ designers reached out to me on the project, Ryan and his work immediately stood out. I had no idea 
      that he was still so early in his career, as his work and his professionalism are far beyond his age.
      <br><br>
      Ryan was prompt, creative, and very flexible with all of my ideas--even the incoherent ones I couldn't communicate well. 
      As a backend developer, I was unsure of how to show off my enterprise coding projects; Ryan had the great idea to 
      write up case studies about each one as a substitute for revealing proprietary source code.
      <br><br>
      I would recommend Ryan to anyone in need of UI/UX design work. He would make a fantastic addition to any team, and I look 
      forward to seeing his career unfold (and reaching out to him when I want to redesign my site!)."
