  <h1 class="ambition-intro-head">A little about me and how I approach the design process.</h1>
  <p class="ambition-intro-content">
    Fresh Junior Product Designer looking for opportunities to push design boundaries and further 
    the user experience thinking. Also looking for Freelance opportunities to continue building my 
    portfolio that I can look back too, knowing that I helped someoneâ€™s business move forward. 
    Only then would I feel accomplished as a problem solver.
    <br><br>
    I think like a user and as a Product Designer. Itâ€™s my goal to have the user get what they came 
    for through a creative and interactive way and to identify how the user experience affects business goals. 
    This level of thinking grew from learning to love the design process after studying Graphic Design and Typography.
    <br><br>
    When engaging in the UX process, I become a total geek when conducting user research, competitive analysis, 
    usability and A/B testing, brand strategy and clean visual design.
    <br><br>
    Finally, when Iâ€™m not working on creative projects, you can find me achieving my ideal physique, behind a computer, 
    actively learning and growing my skills, while feeding my geeky self through my hobbies of gaming, Anime and music.

  <h1 class="testimonials">Testimonials</h1>
  <i class="derek-content">
    "Ryan designed my portfolio website, and I could not have been happier with how everything turned out. 
    Out of 200+ designers reached out to me on the project, Ryan and his work immediately stood out. 
    I had no idea that he was still so early in his career, as his work and his professionalism are far 
    beyond his age.
    <br><br>
    Ryan was prompt, creative, and very flexible with all of my ideas--even the incoherent ones I couldn't 
    communicate well. As a backend developer, I was unsure of how to show off my enterprise coding projects; 
    Ryan had the great idea to write up case studies about each one as a substitute for revealing proprietary 
    source code.
    <br><br>
    I would recommend Ryan to anyone in need of UI/UX design work. He would make a fantastic addition to any team, and I look forward to seeing his career 
    unfold (and reaching out to him when I want to redesign my site!)."
