    <h3 class="about-text">
      <p>I am currently attending my last semester at the California State 
        University, Fullerton. My expected graduation date is May 2020, with 
        a <b>Bachelor’s Degree in Graphic and Interactive Design.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        My portfolio reflects what I am currently cultivating my skills in:
        <br> 
        <br>
        <b>• User Research</b>
        <br>
        <b>• Visual and Interaction design.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        As a designer, it is a 
        given that I strive to make things look strategically appealing, but 
        I am all about the process. I can never complete a design project without
        researching and following the necessary steps that lead to the design. If I attempt to skip the 
        process, I will sit in my chair, staring at my screen for hours, thinking about
        what to do. Even if I do get the "genius" idea, I still need to have a way that 
        builds up to the final design. There is a beauty when gathering the puzzle pieces so 
        that it results in a beautiful, yet effective piece of work.
