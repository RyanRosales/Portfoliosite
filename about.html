  <h1 class="ambition-intro-head">How my work reflects my ambitions as a Designer.</h1>
  <p class="ambition-intro-content">
    Iâ€™ve always been a geeky person all my life. I began playing video games 
    and watching Anime at a young age. Today, I still keep these hobbies of mine and it defines 
    me as a person and influences the design industries I want to work in. 
    <br><br>The industries I want to work for is in tech, gaming, and even Anime. I came to realize 
    the intent on pursuing these specific industries because I want to use my skills as a 
    creative to further the user experiences for the hobbies I grew up with.
    <br><br>
    I'm currently Freelancing to build up my work experience. My services involve 
    designing web and app products for startups and teams. Lastly, my creative process strives 
    to push design boundaries and use my skills in UI/UX, Typography, and current 
    design trends to produce clean and accessible web and UI products.

  <h1 class="testimonials">Testimonials</h1>
  <i class="derek-content">
    "Ryan designed my portfolio website, and I could not have been happier with how everything turned out. 
    Out of 200+ designers reached out to me on the project, Ryan and his work immediately stood out. 
    I had no idea that he was still so early in his career, as his work and his professionalism are far 
    beyond his age.
    <br><br>
    Ryan was prompt, creative, and very flexible with all of my ideas--even the incoherent ones I couldn't 
    communicate well. As a backend developer, I was unsure of how to show off my enterprise coding projects; 
    Ryan had the great idea to write up case studies about each one as a substitute for revealing proprietary 
    source code.
    <br><br>
    I would recommend Ryan to anyone in need of UI/UX design work. He would make a fantastic addition to any team, and I look forward to seeing his career 
    unfold (and reaching out to him when I want to redesign my site!)."
