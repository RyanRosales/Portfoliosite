  <div class="ambition-head">A LITTLE STORY</div>

  <div class="ambition-body">
    With an education in Graphic Design and Typography, an opportunity introduced me to the UX industry, 
    but after learning about the user-centered design process, it made me stay.
    <br><br>
    When I learned that I can improve peopleâ€™s lives through design and create a bridge between people and 
    technology, it made me more determined to break into the UX industry.
    <br><br>
    Now, I am a Product Designer looking for UX opportunities to help businesses create great user-centered 
    solutions for their digital products and build a portfolio that I can look back to, knowing that I helped 
    someoneâ€™s business move forward. Only then would I feel accomplished as a visual problem solver.
    <br><br>
    Itâ€™s my goal to have people achieve what they came for through a creative and interactive way and to identify 
    how a user experience affects business goals.
    <br><br>
    Whether I am doing solo work or collaborating, I make an effort to be greatly involved in all stages of the UX process:
    <br><br>
    â€¢ Concept creation.
    <br><br>
    â€¢ Competitive analysis.
    <br><br>
    â€¢ User research.
    <br><br>
    â€¢ Paper ideations and wireframing.
    <br><br>
    â€¢ A/B and Usability Testing.
    <br><br>
    â€¢ Visual Design.
    <br><br>
    â€¢ Development hand-off.
    <br><br>
    â€¢ Post product launch usability testing.
    <br><br>
    Finally, when Iâ€™m not working on creative projects, you can find me achieving my ideal physique, behind a computer, 
    actively learning and growing my skills, while feeding my geeky self through my hobbies of gaming, Anime and music.

  <div class="derek-review">
    <i>"Ryan designed my portfolio website, and I could not have been happier with how everything turned out. 
      Out of 200+ designers reached out to me on the project, Ryan and his work immediately stood out. I had no idea 
      that he was still so early in his career, as his work and his professionalism are far beyond his age.
      <br><br>
      Ryan was prompt, creative, and very flexible with all of my ideas--even the incoherent ones I couldn't communicate well. 
      As a backend developer, I was unsure of how to show off my enterprise coding projects; Ryan had the great idea to 
      write up case studies about each one as a substitute for revealing proprietary source code.
      <br><br>
      I would recommend Ryan to anyone in need of UI/UX design work. He would make a fantastic addition to any team, and I look 
      forward to seeing his career unfold (and reaching out to him when I want to redesign my site!)."
