  <p class="ambition-intro-content">
    With an education in Graphic Design and Typography, I always longed for something more when pursuing this industry. 
    Essentially, I wanted my creations to influence peopleâ€™s lives...
    <br><br>
    Long story short, soaking my feet in app and web design brought me to UX, but learning the process of user-centered 
    design made me stay. When I learned that I can improve peopleâ€™s lives through design and technology, it made me more 
    determined to break into the UX industry.
    <br><br>
    Now, I am a Product Designer looking for opportunities to help businesses create great user-centered solutions for their 
    digital products and build a portfolio that I can look back to, knowing that I helped someoneâ€™s business move forward. 
    Only then would I feel accomplished as a visual problem solver.
    <br><br>
    By thinking like a user and a designer, itâ€™s my goal to have the user achieve what they came for through a creative and 
    interactive way and to identify how a user experience affects business goals.
    <br><br>
    Finally, when Iâ€™m not working on creative projects, you can find me achieving my ideal physique, behind a computer, 
    actively learning and growing my skills, while feeding my geeky self through my hobbies of gaming, Anime and music.

    "Ryan designed my portfolio website, and I could not have been happier with how everything turned out. 
    Out of 200+ designers reached out to me on the project, Ryan and his work immediately stood out. 
    I had no idea that he was still so early in his career, as his work and his professionalism are far 
    beyond his age.
    <br><br>
    Ryan was prompt, creative, and very flexible with all of my ideas--even the incoherent ones I couldn't 
    communicate well. As a backend developer, I was unsure of how to show off my enterprise coding projects; 
    Ryan had the great idea to write up case studies about each one as a substitute for revealing proprietary 
    source code.
    <br><br>
    I would recommend Ryan to anyone in need of UI/UX design work. He would make a fantastic addition to any team, and I look forward to seeing his career 
    unfold (and reaching out to him when I want to redesign my site!)."
