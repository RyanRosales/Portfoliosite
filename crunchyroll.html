<div class="crunchy-overview">
  <p class="crunchy-overview-head">What is Crunchyroll and Anime?</p>
  <p class="crunchy-overview-para1">
    Crunchyroll is an American video streaming platform that focuses on  licensed 
    Japanese Anime and live-action drama. Anime is short for Japanese animation 
    which is known for its 2-D and stylized art style. In addition, Anime is 
    heavily a part of Japanese culture and has a growing international audience 
    each year.
  </p>
  <p class="crunchy-overview-para5">
    With over <b>70 million registered users</b> (updated July, 2020), <b>13 million monthly active users</b>
    (updated March, 2019), and <b>3 million paying subscribers</b> (updated July, 2020), Crunchyroll is 
    without a doubt the leading Anime streaming service.
  </p>
  <p class="crunchy-overview-para2">
    To understand Japanese TV airing cycles, an Anime series will air one weekly episode. 
    For viewers, they watch an episode and simply wait for the next episode to air on 
    the next scheduled day and time. In addition, Anime is organized into seasons which 
    is commonly known as “Seasonal Anime.” For example, if a series is set to air its 
    first episode in October 2020, then the series would be categorized as “Fall 2020.” 
  </p>
  <p class="crunchy-overview-para3">
    One Anime season typically airs twelve to thirteen episodes with at least a year before 
    a sequel is confirmed to air. In some cases, a series will air two combined seasons 
    into one, which is around twenty-five episodes and will run through an estimated two 
    seasons or six months.
  </p>
  <p class="crunchy-overview-para4">
    With a quick rundown of how Japanese airing cycles work, let’s see how this affects audience 
    demographics. For Japanese audiences, broadcasting stations will announce what day and time 
    an Anime series will air its episodes. However, this gives a disconnection  to international 
    audiences since they are restricted to time differences and they do not have access to Japanese 
    broadcasting services. Instead, they have to look into online resources such as MyAnimeList to 
    figure out what days an Anime will air its next episode.

  <p class="crunchy-problem-content">
    When it comes to the website, I believe almost any Crunchyroll user would agree on is that the 
    it is outdated in regards to the design and functionality. Most notably, the landing page, the Shows page, and the 
    Anime details page. However, the Crunchyroll game and store pages seem to be updated 
    compared to the former pages. So I made a note that when it comes to the redesign, the design must have a clean and 
    consistent flow.

    <p class="crunchy-goals-content">
      After identifying current website problems, the next thought was 
      <b>“How does the current experience affect Crunchyroll’s business?”</b>
      <br><br>
      <b>Crunchyroll’s main forms of revenue:</b>
      <br><br>
      • Premium Subscription allows users to watch Anime without ads and watch new 
      episodes 1-hour after Japanese airing time.
      <br><br>
      • Online Store is where users can purchase Crunchyroll merchandise and other goods.
      <br><br>
      <b>Crunchyroll’s methods of user conversion:</b> <br><br>

      • Anime, Manga, and Drama content <br><br>
      • SEO strategies <br><br>
      • News page <br><br>
      • Mobile games

      <br><br>
      I conducted an online survey with 11 responses that had a question with the intent on 
      finding out if these users use any other website aside from Crunchyroll to watch Anime.  <b>18.2% also use Funimation</b>, <b>81.8% also use Netflix</b>, 
      <b>36.4% also use Hulu</b>, and three of the responders also use YouTube, KissAnime, and Animelab.

      <img class="crunchy-affinity" src="Crunchyroll/affinity-diagram.png"> <br><br>

      Along with research on Crunchyroll’s business, I dug deeper 
      to understand the UX problems. In my survey, I asked the users how they felt 
      about the current design layout, navigation experience, what pages they use the most 
      and the least, and any other issues they may have on the website. While the answers were mixed, feedback requested:

      <br><br>
      • <b>A UI update, especially the landing page and shows page</b> <br><br>

      • <b>Dark mode</b> <br><br>

      • <b>A way to organize their queue/watch lists</b> <br><br>

      • <b>Filter options to improve the search engine</b> <br><br>

      While these requests are mostly a UI change, the outdated design gives a negative user experience overall.<br><br>

      <img class="crunchy-IA" src="Crunchyroll/Crunchyroll IA.jpg"> <br><br>

      After the survey, I studied the flow of the website and I developed a Information Architecture chart to help me 
      gain a better understanding where potential disconnects can happen.

  <div class="container-crunchy-redesign">
    <p class="crunchy-redesign-head">Identifying What Pages to Redesign</p>

    <br><br>
    <p class="crunchy-redesign-content">
    With all the data I acquired through my research, I compiled a list of what to 
    redesign based on business goals and user needs. <br><br>

    <b>Landing page</b> - My solution for this is to give Crunchyroll’s pages a spotlight of their own through the 
    landing page. In theory, I believed this solution could increase revenue and user conversion by making it more noticeable.
    <br><br>
    <b>Shows Page</b> - The user should have the freedom to make their searches as quick and painless as possible. Crunchyroll does 
    have a filtration system for their search engine, but I believe it could be improved so navigation is less confusing.
    <br><br>
    <img class="crunchy-redesign-shows" src="Crunchyroll/shows page.png"> <br><br>

    <b>Queue List</b> - User feedback mentioned that favorited Anime function on the last viewed episode of that Anime. This sparks confusion 
    because many Anime have multiple seasons. I tested this myself with an Anime that I know that currently has 5 seasons. I previewed 
    a random episode from a random season and checked my queue list. It read as “Shokugeki no Soma - Episode 5 *title name*.” My 
    immediate thought was “Well which episode 5 from which season?” <br><br>

    <img class="crunchy-redesign-list" src="Crunchyroll/watch-list.png"> <br><br>

    <b>Anime Details Page</b> - Feedback I received when a user visits the page of an Anime show is to make current shows more apparent on 
    its specific page and on the front page. The current layout is not visually engaging so I kept in my mind to modernize these pages and 
    to <b>have the user feel they are getting what they paid for</b>. <br><br>

    <img class="crunchy-redesign-show" src="Crunchyroll/anime-episode.png">

  <div class="container-crunchy-persona">
    <p class="crunchy-persona-head">Persona</p>
    <p class="crunchy-persona-content">
      I created a persona based on the results of my user research. In addition, I implemented other Crunchyroll 
      statistics that I found while conducting my research; which drove my persona to be a 22-year old Asian male who is a college student. <br><br>

      • <b>75% of Crunchyroll subscribers that are under the age of 35</b> (updated January 2016) <br><br>

      • <b>18 years old is the median age of a Crunchyroll free user</b> (updated January 2016) <br><br>

    <p class="crunchy-wireframe-head">Ideation, Wireframe and A/B Testing</p>
    <p class="crunchy-wireframe-content">
      I jumped into wireframing and through multiple iterations, I found myself 
      coming up with a few great ideas, but needed feedback on what would seem the most efficient in user 
      conversion and an improved user experience. I shared my variations of each solution to my Instagram followers with 
      various backgrounds to gain their insight.<br><br>

    <p class="crunchy-usertest-head">User Testing</p>
    <p class="crunchy-usertest-content">
      After more iterations, I developed a prototype that needed testing. I took 
      4 Crunchyroll users that I know and tested them through a user flow.
    <br><br>

    <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/mhi2vusvkQ1ghBgyThUozG/Crunchyroll-Case-Study?node-id=156%3A2&viewport=217%2C-2917%2C0.10588044673204422&scaling=min-zoom" 
    target="_blank">Check out the Figma Prototype</a> <br><br>

    <b>Task Flow</b> <br><br>
    • Start on the home page <br><br>
    • Navigate to the “Shows” page <br><br>
    • Add an Anime from the “Shows” page to the Watch list <br><br>
    • Navigate to the watch list page and add that Anime to a specific playlist <br><br>
    • Finally, visit the page of that Anime <br><br>

    <b>Results</b> <br><br>
      100% OF THE TESTERS LIKED THE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS, ESPECIALLY THE FILTER THAT I ADDED ON THE 
      SHOWS PAGE AND WATCH LIST. <br><br>

      <b>"I didn’t know they had a store."</b> <br><br>

      <b>“Easier to use than what Crunchyroll has right now.”</b> <br><br>

      <b>“Smoother. Feels like Hulu.”</b> <br><br>
    
      <b>“I would pay for Crunchyroll”</b>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container-crunchy-final">
    <p class="crunchy-final-head">Design Solutions</p>
    <p class="crunchy-content">
      <b>Storytelling</b> - By updating the design into a storytelling layout, the landing page 
      is now visually engaging and each Crunchyroll page: Shows, Manga, News, Store, and Games are highlighted. 
      In theory, I believed it would increase revenue and user conversion due to all Crunchyroll services being 
      much more visible and giving a clear call-to-action to subscribing to their premium service. <br><br>

      <img class="crunchy-storytelling" src="Crunchyroll/Signed out UI Final.png"> <br><br>

      <b>Shows Page</b> - Dark mode was desired from the survey, so I changed the “Shows” page into dark mode for easier 
      viewing as the user utilizes the search engine. In addition, I cleaned up the layout, adding more white space 
      so that the Anime listings can be processed more easily. I reduced the filtration system to Trending, Seasonal, Drama, 
      and Genres as filters such as "alphabetical," are confusing and should be implemented by default. Finally, I included a sorting filter to optimize the search engine. <br><br>

      <img class="crunchy-shows-page" src="Crunchyroll/Anime List UI.png"> <br><br> 

      <b>Watch List</b> - I personally felt that not everyone will understand what a “queue list” is, so I decided to change the name 
      to “Watch list,” to give a bit more clarity on what this page is. On this page I made changes to treat each Anime 
      season as its own page and not combine multiple seasons into one category. <br><br>
      Within the watch list, users can see what Anime are currently airing and options to organize their content. The user has the freedom 
      to create multiple playlists, which can help organize content for users who happen to share their account with multiple people.
      Finally, I added playlist and genre filters for quick and easy navigation.

      <br><br>

      <img class="crunchy-watch-list" src="Crunchyroll/Watch List-redesign.png">

      <br><br>

      <b>Show Details Page</b> - The Anime details page is now more visually engaging by making the video preview much larger and 
      more apparent. In terms of functionality, when a user enters the page of an Anime, their progress is saved according to the last episode
      they watched. So when they return at a later time they can quickly continue where they left off. <br><br>
      
      Following the new video preview, the user can add the Anime 
      to a playlist, quickly jump to another episode, and read general information about the series. <br><br>

      <img class="crunchy-show-details" src="Crunchyroll/Anime Series Info UI.png"> <br><br>

      <b>Responsive Design</b> - Finally, I made a responsive layout as the current website is not responsive. <br><br>

      <img class="crunchy-responsive" src="Crunchyroll/Responsive.png">

  <div class="crunchy-recap">
    <p class="crunchy-recap-head">Final Thoughts</p>
    <p class="crunchy-recap-content">I had a great time doing this redesign and I’m proud of the results. 
      If I could go back, I would definitely do more user testing to maximize feedback on the proposed solutions. 
      Other than that, it felt crazy to me how much the research and understanding business goals naturally drove 
      the design solutions so that the results produced a user-centered and clean design.
