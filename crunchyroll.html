        <h1>Prioritizing the needs of Crunchyroll users</h1>
        <h3>More and more people each year are turning to content streaming as a main form of home entertainment. 
            In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has given people, especially western audiences, more time exploring new 
            content to enjoy from Korean dramas and even Japanese Anime. 
        </h3>
        <h3>I spent one week examining the west‚Äôs leading Anime streaming platform, Crunchyroll, and identifying existing problems 
            that‚Äôs currently producing a poor user experience. By the end of this redesign, I prodcued design solutions that could increase user satisfaction and 
            potentially benefit the business.

    <h3>The home page was updated to current design trends for content platforms. In addition, it highlights various Crunchyroll features, 
        from viewing Anime content to visiting their merchandise store. With an updated design, in theory, users are more inclined to use Crunchyroll 
        more due to eye-catching visuals and a sense of trust towards the platform.

      <h4>RESEARCH</h4>
      <h1>Synthesizing secondary and primary research</h1>
      <h3>To identify underlying problems I conducted secondary and primary research to examine common pain points, 
          market trends and competitors.
      </h3>
  
      <h2>Main insights</h2>
      <h3><b>A UI update</b></h3>
      <h3>‚Ä¢ Survey responders commented that the current layout is "old" compared to other platforms such as Netflix.</h3>
  
      <h3><b>Dark mode</b></h3>
      <h3>‚Ä¢ Survey responders mentioned they preferred dark mode to watch Anime as it's easier on their eyes.</h3>
  
      <h3><b>Users want a way to organize their queue lists</b></h3>
      <h3>‚Ä¢ 81% of survery responders complained that they can't control their playlists. In addition, the current functionality is 
          confusing and the copywriting of episodes misleads users into thinking they saved the wrong episode.
      </h3>
  
      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <h3>I researched direct and indirect competitors to see how they approached their streaming experience.</h3>

<!--Userflow-->
<section class="content">
  <div class="container">
    <h4>USERFLOW</h4>
    <h1>Ideating the experience</h1>
    <h3>With all the data I gathered from my research, I mapped out Crunchyroll‚Äôs current architecture and identified specific pages that directly affect the user experience.</h3>
    <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Crunchyroll/Research/Crunchyroll IA.png">
    <h3>Crunchyroll‚Äôs current information architecture.</h3>
    <br>
    <h2>Identifying the pain points </h2>
    <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Crunchyroll/Research/crunchy-currentlanding.png">
    <h3>The home page is the user‚Äôs first impression of a product. My interview results mentioned this page is one of the reasons why the website ‚Äúfeels old.‚Äù</h3>
    <br><br>
    <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Crunchyroll/Research/crunchy-currentqueue.png">
    <h3>The queue list indicated user frustration due to its lack of usability. Based off from the image above, content is saved based on the what was last favorited. 
        In addition, content titles are misleading as it only mentions the name of an Anime and its episode. 
        <br><br>
        For example, Sword Art Online has multiple seasons and each have seperate titles, yet it just says the general name and the episode number. Users are forced to 
        ‚Äúthink‚Äù about what season is episode 15 corresponding too.
        <br><br>
        With UX problems found in this feature, I knew I had to redesign it to provide context for users and give control over their playlists.

    <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Crunchyroll/Research/crunchy-currentinfo.png">
    <h3>
        Finally, the shows page could have a touch up on its hierarchy. While the video is the first thing users will look at and there are clear call-to-actions, all visual elements feel 
        contained inside a box. I needed to give it a modern look and provide breathing room between design elements.
    </h3>
    <br>
    <h2>Designing the wireframes</h2>
    <h3>During the wireframing stage, I kept in mind to keep the experience intuitive and all of the visual elements modern.</h3>

        feedback on the new queue list and the overall UI layout.</h3>
