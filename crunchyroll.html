  <p class="crunchy-role-description">A solo project where I wanted to improve

<div class="crunchy-overview">
  <p class="crunchy-overview-head">What is Crunchyroll and Anime?</p>
  <p class="crunchy-overview-para1">
    Crunchyroll is an American video streaming platform that focuses on  licensed 
    Japanese Anime and live-action drama. Anime is short for Japanese animation 
    which is known for its 2-D and stylized art style. In addition, Anime is 
    heavily a part of Japanese culture and has a growing international audience 
    each year.
  </p>
  <p class="crunchy-overview-para2">
    To understand Japanese TV airing cycles, an Anime series will air one weekly episode. 
    For viewers, they watch an episode and simply wait for the next episode to air on 
    the next scheduled day and time. In addition, Anime is organized into seasons which 
    is commonly known as “Seasonal Anime.” For example, if a series is set to air its 
    first episode in October 2020, then the series would be categorized as “Fall 2020.” 
  </p>
  <p class="crunchy-overview-para3">
    One Anime season typically airs twelve to thirteen episodes with at least a year before 
    a sequel is confirmed to air. In some cases, a series will air two combined seasons 
    into one, which is around twenty-five episodes and will run through an estimated two 
    seasons or six months.
  </p>
  <p class="crunchy-overview-para4">
    With a quick rundown of how Japanese airing cycles work, let’s see how this affects audience 
    demographics. For Japanese audiences, broadcasting stations will announce what day and time 
    an Anime series will air its episodes. However, this gives a disconnection  to international 
    audiences since they are restricted to time differences and they do not have access to Japanese 
    broadcasting services. Instead, they have to look into online resources such as MyAnimeList to 
    figure out what days an Anime will air its next episode.

<div class="crunchy-problem">
  <p class="crunchy-problem-head">Defining Existing Website and App Problems</p>
  <p class="crunchy-problem-content">
    Crunchyroll’s website is rather outdated and neglected compared to the app in 
    terms of design and functionality. Mainly the home page since that is the first 
    page a user will land too. My analysis was backed by my own user research and 
    public reviews; claiming that Crunchyroll is known for its “poor interface.”

  <div class="crunchy-web-problems">
    <b>Website Problems</b>
    <p>• Non-responsive<br><br>
      • Home page is not visually engaging<br><br>
      • Anime shows are laid out in a long unorganized list that 
      the user must scroll through to find specific anime.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="crunchy-app-problems">
    <b>App Problems</b>
    <p>• Home page tries to fit so much content 
      with limited space<br><br>
      • Every so often an Anime series is featured in a square card 
      that looks like an advertisement and it feels out of place.<br><br>

      The main issue with the website and app is that the homepages tries to feature 
      so much content that it’s not allowing other pages, such as the simulcast 
      page, to do its job of providing users specific information. The homepages 
      should feature a limited amount of content since there are pages that are 
      dedicated to holding all content.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="crunchy-goals">
    <h1 class="crunchy-goals-head">Goals</h1>
    <p class="crunchy-goals-content">
      • Redesign and create a responsive website home page.<br><br>
      • Clean up the app's home page and give hierarchy to the shows page.

  <div class="crunchy-competitors">
    <p class="crunchy-competitors-head">Defining Crunchyroll's Competitors</p>
    <p class="crunchy-competitors-content">
      • Funimation - Anime video streaming platform<br><br>

      • Netflix - Leading video streaming platform<br><br>

      • Hulu - Leading video streaming platform<br><br>

      • Amazon Prime Video - Video streaming platform<br><br>

      • Illegal Anime streaming platforms<br><br>

      Now Crunchyroll has some competition, especially with big names such as 
      Netflix and Hulu. While Netflix, Hulu and Prime Video do not focus on 
      Anime, they all have large Anime libraries that is enough to give users a 
      wide selection. Not to mention a plethora of illegal streaming sites that 
      users can go to without paying a subscription.

  <div class="crunchy-user-research">
    <p class="crunchy-user-research-head">User Research</p>
    <p class="crunchy-user-research-content">
      I was able to ask three people that have used Crunchyroll regarding 
      their thoughts of the website and app.<br><br>
      1 out of 3 - said the site looks like a blog and boring<br>

      2 out of 3 - said the site looks cluttered and non-functional<br>

      3 out of 3 - said they prefer the app over the website<br><br>

      I felt that I needed more user information aside from my interviews. 
      So I turned to public reviews and looked for comments that referred to 
      the website and app UX and functionality.

    <p class="crunchy-recap-head">Final Thoughts</p>
    <p class="crunchy-recap-content">The redesign was aimed to modernize Crunchyroll’s 
      website through current Typography trends and a cleaner UI. In addition, the current 
      app interface is well thought out, but is trying to fit so much content with little 
      space. To further the design, I added more breathing room and gave hierarchy on the 
      home page and the show’s details page.
