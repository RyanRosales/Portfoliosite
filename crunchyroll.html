        <h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
        <h2>A redesign of a leading Anime streaming platform where I modernized the UI and created a solution to organize saved Anime playlists.
        </h2>
        <h2><b>The Problem</b></h2>
        <h2>Crunchyroll is the leading online distributor of licensed Japanese Anime for western audiences. However, with other distributors such 
            as Netflix showcasing their own libraries of licensed Anime, users feel that the company needs to update their services to keep up with their competition.

<!--Research-->
<section class="content">
    <div class="container">
        <h1>RESEARCH</h1>
        <h3>In my research, I needed to understand the business and how much influence it currently holds in the Anime market. With over <b>70 million 
            registered users</b> (updated July, 2020), <b>13 million monthly active users</b> (updated March, 2019), and <b>3 million paying subscribers</b> (updated July, 2020), 
            Crunchyroll is without a doubt the leading Anime streaming service for western audiences.
        </h3>
        <h3><b>Business Goals</b></h3>
        <h3>Crunchyroll's main forms of revenue is its <b>Premium subscription</b> and <b>online store</b>. 
            <br><br>
            The subscription allows users to watch Anime without advertisements and the ability to watch new episodes one hour after Japanese airing time. In addition, their store 
            houses many Anime merchandise and other goods.
        </h3>
        <h3><b>User Conversion</b></h3>
        <h3>Their methods of conversion are Anime, Manga, and drama content, SEO, news pages, and mobile games.
        </h3>

        <h3><b>Competitive Analysis</b></h3>
        <h3>Data from my survey mentioned that <b>18.2% of users also use Funimation</b>, <b>81.8% also use Netflix</b>, <b>36.4% also use Hulu</b>, and three responders also use third-party websites.</h3>
        <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Crunchyroll/Research/stream-platform-chart.png">

        <h3><b>User Feedback</b></h3>
        <h3>I conducted an online survey with <b>14 responders</b> and I asked for their overall experience using Crunchyroll and their personal suggestions for improvement. Feedback requested:
        </h3>
        <h3>
            <b>• A UI update, especially the landing page and shows page.</b>
            <br><br>
            <b>• Dark mode.</b>
            <br><br>
            <b>•  A way to organize their queue/watch lists.</b>
            <br><br>
            <b>•  Filter options to improve the search engine.</b>
            <br><br>

<!--What to redesign-->
<section class="content">
    <div class="container">
        <h1>IDENTIFYING WHAT PAGES TO REDESIGN</h1>
        <h3><b>Landing page</b>- Many users don't notice and utilize all of Crunchyroll's content. The optimal solution was to highlight Crunchyroll's navigation bar.
        </h3>
        <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Crunchyroll/Current-design/landing-page.png">
        
        <h3><b>Shows page</b>- Users should have the freedom to make their searches as quick and painless as possible. Crunchyroll does have a filtration system for their 
            search engine, but user feedback proved this confusing.
        </h3>
        <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Crunchyroll/Current-design/shows page.png">

        <h3><b>Queue List</b>- User feedback mentioned that favorited Anime is listed on the last viewed episode. This sparks confusion because many Anime have multiple seasons.
            <br><br>
            I tested this with an Anime that currently has 5 seasons. I previewed a random episode from a random season and checked my queue list. It read as “Shokugeki no Soma — 
            Episode 5 *title name*.” Titles aren't specified and can lead to confusion.
        </h3>
        <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Crunchyroll/Current-design/watch-list.png">

        <h3><b>Anime Info Page</b>- Feedback mentioned that info pages should have enlarged the video previews and make the layout visually engaging. Users should feel 
            they are paying for high quality content.
        </h3>
        <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Crunchyroll/Current-design/anime-episode.png">
    </div>
</section>

<!--Wireframe-->
<section class="content">
    <div class="container">
        <h1>WIREFRAME AND A/B TESTING</h1>
        <h3>I jumped into wireframing and through multiple iterations, I conducted A/B testing on a few screens to my Instagram followers for feedback. Then I continued iterating 
            screens that received higher ratings by my followers.
        </h3>
        <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Crunchyroll/usability/a_b-testing.png">
    </div>
</section>

<!--Testing-->
<section class="content">
    <div class="container">
        <h1>USABILITY TESTING</h1>
        <h3>I took 4 Crunchyroll users and had them test my prototype. Surprisingly, 100% of the testers liked the proposed solutions.
        </h3>
        <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/mhi2vusvkQ1ghBgyThUozG/Crunchyroll-Case-Study?node-id=156%3A2&viewport=130%2C-387%2C0.05948466435074806&scaling=min-zoom" target="blank"><b>Click for the Figma prototype</b></a>
    </div>
</section>

<!--Solutions-->
<section class="content">
    <div class="container">
        <h1>SOLUTIONS</h1>
        <h3><b>Storytelling</b>- Now with a modern layout, the landing page is simpler and more visually engaging.
            <br><br>
            I believe this approach would increase revenue and improve user conversion due to all Crunchyroll services being much more visible, along with clear call-to-actions.
        </h3>
        <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Crunchyroll/Hi-Fi/Signed out UI Final.png">

        <h3><b>Shows Page</b>- User feedback desired dark mode as many commented about eye strain. Finally, I simplified the search filter to optimize the search engine.
        </h3>
        <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Crunchyroll/Hi-Fi/Anime List UI.png">

        <h3><b>Watch List</b>- Users have the freedom to create multiple playlists, where they can organize their content.
            <br><br>
            This helps those who happen to share their account with multiple people. Finally, I added playlist and genre filters for quick and easy navigation.
        </h3>
        <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Crunchyroll/Hi-Fi/Watch List-redesign.png">

        <h3><b>Show Info Page</b>- A modernized layout gives hierarchy to a show's content. Progress is saved according to the last episode they watched which allows 
            users to continue where they left off.
        </h3>
        <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Crunchyroll/Hi-Fi/Anime Series Info UI.png">

        <h3><b>Responsive Design</b>- Finally, I made a responsive layout as the current website is not responsive.
        </h3>
        <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Crunchyroll/Hi-Fi/Responsive.png">

<!--Conclusion-->
<section class="content">
    <div class="container">
        <h1>FINAL THOUGHTS</h1>
        <h3>Since I was a one-man team for this redesign, I took this opportunity to put my full UX arsenal into practice to gather as much data from Crunchyroll 
            and its users and use that information to drive the design solutions.
            <br><br>
            If I could go back, I would do more usability testing to maximize feedback on the proposed solutions.
