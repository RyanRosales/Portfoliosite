        <h1>Redesigning Crunchyroll‚Äôs streaming experience</h1>
        <h3>More and more people each year are turning to content streaming as a main form of home entertainment. 
            In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has given people, especially western audiences, more time exploring new 
            content to enjoy from Korean dramas and even Japanese Anime. 
        </h3>
        <h3>I spent one week examining the west‚Äôs leading Anime streaming platform, Crunchyroll, and identifying existing problems 
            that‚Äôs currently producing a poor user experience. By the end of this redesign, I prodcued design solutions that could increase user satisfaction and 
            potentially benefit the business.

    <h4>SECONDARY RESEARCH</h4>
    <h1>Anime‚Äôs global influence</h1>
    <h3>In my research, before I focused on Crunchyroll‚Äôs business, I dug deeper to understand Anime‚Äôs global influence. </h3>

    <h2>What is Japanese Anime?</h2>
    <h3>Anime is a Japanese style of animation, where the name is short for the English word ‚Äúanimation.‚Äù It‚Äôs known for its 2D, stylized art style 
        with distinct physical features, such as large eyes, multi-colored hair and small mouths. While the art-style visually looks like it‚Äôs meant 
        for child audiences, it covers a wide range of genres, such as romance, science fiction, and horror.
    </h3>

    <h2>How has it influenced the world?</h2>
    <h3>Anime has gained huge popularity around the world, beginning in the 1990s. The culture has taken new forms in and outside of Japan as public conventions 
        where fans come together in mass-gatherings to enjoy Anime content. In addition, some people participate in a costume dress up called ‚Äúcosplay,‚Äù where they 
        wear the clothes of their favorite characters (which are often handmade) and partake in roleplaying.
        <br><br>
        <blockquote>
            <p class="quote"><q>The animation industry in Japan generated a revenue of approximately ¬•1.2 trillion (JPY) ($10.8 million USD) in 2019.</q></p>
            <footer class="quote-source">- Statista</footer>
        </blockquote>
    </h3>
    <br>
    <h2>Anime‚Äôs influence towards western animations</h2>
    <h3>Since the 2000s, the Japanese art-style has crept its way into western cartoons. A notable example of its influence is the 2005 American animated series, ‚ÄúAvatar: The Last Airbender,‚Äù and its sequel 
        in 2012, ‚ÄúAvatar: The Legend of Korra.‚Äù Although, the influence hasn‚Äôt stopped in the Americas. It has made its way to European countries, such as the the 2015 French animated series, ‚ÄúMiraculous: Tales 
        of Ladybug and Cat Noir.‚Äù 
        <br><br>
        While many western animated studios claim their content is not Anime, there‚Äôs no denying that these western art-styles have been greatly influenced by its Japanese counterpart.
    </h3>
    
    <h2>What is Crunchyroll?</h2>
    <h3>Crunchyroll is an American Anime content distributor for western audiences that offers both English subtitles and dubs. Like other content platforms, Crunchyroll markets a premium subscription for the highest 
        quality customer experience. For example, if a user subscribes, they have access to new episodes one-hour after its Japanese broadcast.
        <br><br>
        With over 70 million registered users (updated July, 2020), 13 million monthly active users (updated March, 2019), and 3 million paying subscribers (updated July, 2020), Crunchyroll is without a doubt the West‚Äôs 
        leading Anime streaming service.
        <br><br>
        <blockquote>
            <p class="quote"><q>As of July, 2020, Crunchyroll has over 70 million registered users with 3 million paying subscribers.</q></p>

<!--Business Value-->
<section class="content">
  <div class="container">
    <h4>BUSINESS VALUE</h4>
    <h1>Why should Crunchyroll use design trends?</h1>
    <h3>It‚Äôs a known fact that the most successful businesses are design-oriented and that their products make a lasting impression on consumers.
        <br><br>
        I did an analysis on the net worth between Crunchyroll and Netflix in 2020. Crunchyroll was worth $1.175 billion while Netflix $225.79 billion. 
        However, I chose to do this analysis to measure the value of design and not compare both companies since each target specific audiences and media.
    </h3>

    <h2>Design builds trust in users</h2>
    <h3>For the average consumer, design is how the product looks. If a product looks good, it will attract attention. Now, how much more valuable is that product if consumers can easily use it? 
      <br><br>
      In Crunchyroll‚Äôs case, even if users were required to pay a monthly subscription in exchange for the highest quality streaming service, as well as beautiful and clean aesthetics, 
      then users wouldn‚Äôt mind having their monthly expenses spent on Crunchyroll.
    </h3>
      <h2>Happy users boost revenue and conversion</h2>
      <h3>I also looked into Crunchyroll‚Äôs forms of revenue and conversion to see how it can influence my designs.</h3>
      <h3>Aside from Crunchyroll‚Äôs main form of revenue, the premium subscription, I looked into conversion rates.</h3>
      <h3>‚Ä¢ Anime, Manga, and Drama content.</h3>
      <h3>‚Ä¢ SEO</h3>
      <h3>‚Ä¢ News page.</h3>
      <h3>‚Ä¢ Word of mouth.</h3>

    <h2>Interview results</h2>

    <h4>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h4>
    <h1>Who are the competitors?</h1>

    <h4>USERFLOW</h4>
    <h1>Ideating the experience</h1>
    <h3>With all the data I gathered from my research, I mapped out Crunchyroll‚Äôs current architecture and identified specific pages that directly affect the user experience.</h3>
    <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Crunchyroll/Research/Crunchyroll IA.png">
    <h3>Crunchyroll‚Äôs current information architecture.</h3>
    <br>
    <h2>Identifying the pain points </h2>
    <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Crunchyroll/Research/crunchy-currentlanding.png">
    <h3>The home page is the user‚Äôs first impression of a product. My interview results mentioned this page is one of the reasons why the website ‚Äúfeels old.‚Äù</h3>
    <br><br>
    <img class="img" src="portfolio-files/Crunchyroll/Research/crunchy-currentqueue.png">
    <h3>The queue list indicated user frustration due to its lack of usability. Based off from the image above, content is saved based on the what was last favorited. 
        In addition, content titles are misleading as it only mentions the name of an Anime and its episode. 
        <br><br>
        For example, Sword Art Online has multiple seasons and each have seperate titles, yet it just says the general name and the episode number. Users are forced to 
        ‚Äúthink‚Äù about what season is episode 15 corresponding too.
        <br><br>
        With UX problems found in this feature, I knew I had to redesign it to provide context for users and give control over their playlists.

    <h3>
        Finally, the shows page could have a touch up on its hierarchy. While the video is the first thing users will look at and there are clear call-to-actions, all visual elements feel 
        contained inside a box. I needed to give it a modern look and provide breathing room between design elements.

    <br>
    <h2>Designing the wireframes</h2>
    <h3>During the wireframing stage, I kept in mind to keep the experience intuitive and all of the visual elements modern.</h3>
