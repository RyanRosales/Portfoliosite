  <div class="crunchy-overview-head">WHAT IS CRUNCHYROLL AND ANIME?</div>
  <div class="crunchy-overview-body">Crunchyroll is an American video streaming platform that focuses on licensed 
    Japanese Anime and live-action drama. 
    <br><br>
    Anime is short for Japanese animation which is known for its 2-D and 
    stylized art style. In addition, Anime is heavily a part of Japanese culture and has a growing 
    international audience each year.
    <br><br>
    With over <b>70 million registered users </b>(updated July, 2020), <b>13 million monthly active users</b> (updated March, 2019), 
    and <b>3 million paying subscribers </b>(updated July, 2020), Crunchyroll is without a doubt the leading Anime streaming service.

    In my survey, I asked users how they felt about the design layout and overall experience. Feedback requested:
    <br><br>
    • <b>A UI update, especially the landing page and shows page.</b>
    <br><br>
    • <b>Dark mode.</b>
    <br><br>
    • <b>A way to organize their queue/watch lists.</b>

  <div class="crunchy-redesign-head">IDENTIFYING WHAT PAGES TO REDESIGN</div>
  <div class="crunchy-redesign-body">
    <b>Landing page</b> - Many users don't notice and utilize all of Crunchyroll's content. The optimal
    solution was to highlight Crunchyroll's navigation bar.
    <br><br>

    <div class="crunchy-redesign-landing">
      <img src="Crunchyroll/landing-page.png">
    </div>

    <br><br>
    <b>Shows Page</b> - Users should have the freedom to make their searches as quick and painless as possible. 
    <br><br>

    <div class="crunchy-redesign-shows">
      <img src="Crunchyroll/shows page.png">
    </div>

    <br><br>
    <b>Queue List</b> - User feedback mentioned that favorited Anime is listed on the last viewed episode. 
    This sparks confusion because many Anime have multiple seasons.
    <br><br>
    I tested this with an Anime that currently has 5 seasons. I previewed a random episode 
    from a random season and checked my queue list. It read as “Shokugeki no Soma — Episode 5 *title name*.” 
    My immediate thought was <b>“Episode 5 from which season?”</b>
    <br><br>

    <b>Users should feel they are paying for high quality content.</b>

    <br><br>

    I took <b>4 Crunchyroll users</b> and had them test my prototype.
    <br><br>
    <b>Results</b>
    <br><br>
    100% OF THE TESTERS LIKED THE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS, ESPECIALLY THE CONTENT FILTERS I ADDED ON THE SHOWS AND WATCH LIST PAGES.
    <br><br>
    <b>"I didn’t know they had a store."</b>

<div class="crunchy-solution">
  <div class="crunchy-solution-head">MOVING FORWARD WITH THE DESIGN SOLUTIONS</div>
  <div class="crunchy-solution-body">
    <b>Storytelling</b> - By modernizing the layout, the landing page is simpler and more visually engaging. 
    <br><br>
    I believe this approach would increase revenue and 
    improve user conversion due to all Crunchyroll services being much more visible, along with clear call-to-actions.

    <div class="crunchy-landing-solution">
      <img src="Crunchyroll/Signed out UI Final.png">
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <b>Shows page</b> - User feedback desired dark mode as many commented about eye strain. Finally, I simplified the search filter to optimize the search engine.
    <br><br>

    <div class="crunchy-list-solution">
      <img src="Crunchyroll/Anime List UI.png">
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <b>Watch List</b> - Users have the freedom to create multiple playlists, where they can organize their content. 
    <br><br>This helps those who happen to share their account with multiple people. 
    Finally, I added playlist and genre filters for quick and easy navigation.
    <br><br>

    <div class="crunchy-watch-list-solution">
      <img src="Crunchyroll/Watch List-redesign.png">
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <b>Show Info Page</b> - A modernized layout gives hierarchy to a show's content. Progress is saved according to the 
    last episode they watched which allows users to continue where they left off.
    <br><br>

  <div class="crunchy-thoughts-body">
    I’m proud of the results and I definitely think that the results could 
    be one way to improve Crunchyroll’s user experience. 
    <br><br>
    If I could go back, I would do 
    more usability testing to maximize feedback on the proposed solutions.
