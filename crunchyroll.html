  <p class="crunchy-overview-para1">
    Crunchyroll is an American video streaming platform that focuses on  licensed 
    Japanese Anime and live-action drama. Anime is short for Japanese animation 
    which is known for its 2-D and stylized art style. In addition, Anime is 
    heavily a part of Japanese culture and has a growing international audience 
    each year.
  </p>
  <p class="crunchy-overview-para2">
    With over <b>70 million registered users</b> (updated July, 2020), <b>13 million monthly active users</b>
    (updated March, 2019), and <b>3 million paying subscribers</b> (updated July, 2020), Crunchyroll is 
    without a doubt the leading Anime streaming service.

      Along with research on Crunchyroll’s business, I dug deeper 
      to understand the UX problems. In my survey, I asked the users how they felt 
      about the current design layout, navigation experience, what pages they use the most 
      and the least, and any other issues they may have on the website. While the answers were mixed, feedback requested:

      <br><br>
      • <b>A UI update, especially the landing page and shows page</b> <br><br>

      • <b>Dark mode</b> <br><br>

      • <b>A way to organize their queue/watch lists</b> <br><br>

      • <b>Filter options to improve the search engine</b> <br><br>

      The feedback showed that the users who addressed their opinions towards the outdated design gave them a 
      negative user experience overall and the desire to have a way to organize their saved Anime into different playlists.<br><br>

      <img class="crunchy-IA" src="Crunchyroll/Crunchyroll IA.jpg"> <br><br>

      After the survey, I studied the flow of the website and I developed a Information Architecture chart to help me 
      gain a better understanding where potential disconnects can happen.

    <p class="crunchy-redesign-head">Identifying What Pages to Redesign</p>

    <br><br>
    <p class="crunchy-redesign-content">
    With all the data I acquired through my research, I compiled a list of what to 
    redesign based on business goals and user needs. <br><br>

    <b>Landing page</b> - My solution for this was to give Crunchyroll’s pages a spotlight of their own through the landing page. 
    My goal was to improve user conversion and increase revenue.
    <br><br>
    <img class="crunchy-landing-page" src="Crunchyroll/landing-page.png"> <br><br>
    <b>Shows Page</b>- Users should have the freedom to make their searches as quick and painless as possible. 
    Crunchyroll does have a filtration system for their search engine, but I believe it could be improved as the current 
    navigation can be confusing. For example, there is an “alphabetical” tab and I thought “wouldn’t it be more efficient to have 
    Anime shows ordered alphabetically by default and decrease the amount of filter options?”
    <br><br>
    <img class="crunchy-redesign-shows" src="Crunchyroll/shows page.png"> <br><br>

    <b>Queue List</b> - User feedback mentioned that favorited Anime is listed on the last viewed episode. This sparks confusion 
    because many Anime have multiple seasons.<br><br>

    I tested this myself with an Anime that I know that currently has 5 seasons. I previewed a random episode from a random season and checked my queue list. 
    It read as “Shokugeki no Soma — Episode 5 *title name*.” My immediate thought was <b>“Episode 5 from which season?”</b> <br><br>

    <img class="crunchy-redesign-list" src="Crunchyroll/watch-list.png"> <br><br>

    <b>Anime Details Page</b> - Feedback I received when a user visits the page of an Anime show is to make current shows more apparent on its specific page and 
    on the front page. The current layout is not visually engaging so I kept in my mind to modernize it and <b>have the user feel they are paying for high quality content.</b> <br><br>

  <div class="container-crunchy-persona">
    <p class="crunchy-persona-head">Persona</p>
    <p class="crunchy-persona-content">
      I created a persona based on the results of my user research. In addition, I implemented other Crunchyroll 
      statistics that I found while conducting my research; which drove my persona to be a 22-year old Asian male who is a college student. <br><br>

      • <b>75% of subscribers are under the age of 35</b> (updated January 2016) <br><br>

      • <b>Median age of free users: 18 years old</b> (updated January 2016) <br><br>

    <p class="crunchy-wireframe-head">Ideation, Wireframe and A/B Testing</p>
    <p class="crunchy-wireframe-content">
      I jumped into wireframing and through multiple iterations, I found myself coming up with a few ideas, but needed feedback on what 
      would seem the most efficient in improving user conversion and the user experience. I shared my variations of each solution 
      to my Instagram followers with various backgrounds to gain their insight.<br><br>

    <p class="crunchy-usertest-content">
      After more iterations, I developed a prototype that needed testing. <b>I took 
        4 Crunchyroll users</b> that I know and tested them through a user flow.
    <br><br>

    <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/mhi2vusvkQ1ghBgyThUozG/Crunchyroll-Case-Study?node-id=156%3A2&viewport=217%2C-2917%2C0.10588044673204422&scaling=min-zoom" 
    target="_blank">Check out the Figma Prototype</a> <br><br>

    <b>Task Flow</b> <br><br>
    • Start on the home page <br><br>
    • Navigate to the “Shows” page <br><br>
    • Add an Anime from the “Shows” page to the Watch list <br><br>
    • Navigate to the watch list page and add that Anime to a specific playlist <br><br>
    • Finally, visit the page of that Anime <br><br>

    <b>Results</b> <br><br>
      100% OF THE TESTERS LIKED THE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS, ESPECIALLY THE CONTENT FILTERS I ADDED ON THE SHOWS AND WATCH LIST PAGES. <br><br>

      <b>"I didn’t know they had a store."</b> <br><br>

      <b>“Easier to use than what Crunchyroll has right now.”</b> <br><br>

      <b>“Smoother. Feels like Hulu.”</b> <br><br>
    
      <b>“I would pay for Crunchyroll”</b>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container-crunchy-final">
    <p class="crunchy-final-head">Moving Forward With The Design Solutions</p>
    <p class="crunchy-content">
      <b>Storytelling</b> - By updating the design into a storytelling layout, and giving off Netflix and Hulu vibes, the landing page is 
      more visually engaging and each Crunchyroll page: Shows, Manga, News, Store, and Games are highlighted. I believe this approach would 
      increase revenue and user conversion due to all Crunchyroll services being much more visible and clear call-to-actions to subscribe to 
      their premium service. <br><br>

      <img class="crunchy-storytelling" src="Crunchyroll/Signed out UI Final.png"> <br><br>

      <b>Shows Page</b> - User feedback desired dark mode as many commented about eye strain. So I changed the “Shows” page into dark mode for 
      easier viewing as users utilize the search engine. In addition, I cleaned up the layout, adding more white space so that the Anime listings 
      has breathing room and can be processed more easily. I reduced the filtration system to Trending, Seasonal, Drama, and Genres as filters such 
      as “alphabetical,” are confusing and should be implemented by default. Finally, I included a sorting filter to optimize the search engine.<br><br>

      <img class="crunchy-shows-page" src="Crunchyroll/Anime List UI.png"> <br><br> 

      <b>Watch List</b> - I personally felt that not everyone will understand what a “queue list” is, so I decided to change the name to “Watch list,” to give a bit 
      more clarity on what this page does. To eliminate confusion, I made changes to treat each Anime season as its own page and not combine multiple seasons 
      into one category. <br><br>
      Within the watch list page, users can see what Anime are currently airing and options to organize their content. They have the freedom to create multiple 
      playlists, which can help organize content for users, especially those who happen to share their account with multiple people. Finally, I added playlist and 
      genre filters for quick and easy navigation.<br><br>

      <img class="crunchy-watch-list" src="Crunchyroll/Watch List-redesign.png">

      <br><br>

      <b>Show Details Page</b> - The Anime details page is now more visually engaging by making the video preview much larger and more apparent. In terms of 
      functionality, when a user enters the page of an Anime series, their progress is saved according to the last episode they watched. So when they return at a later 
      time they can quickly continue where they left off. <br><br>
      
      Following the new video preview, the user can add that Anime to a playlist, quickly jump to another episode, and read general 
      information about the series. <br><br>

      <img class="crunchy-show-details" src="Crunchyroll/Anime Series Info UI.png"> <br><br>

      <b>Responsive Design</b> - Finally, I made a responsive layout as the current website is not responsive. <br><br>

  <div class="crunchy-recap">
    <p class="crunchy-recap-head">Final Thoughts</p>
    <p class="crunchy-recap-content">I had a great time doing this redesign and I’m proud of the results. If I could go back, I would do more usability testing to 
      maximize feedback on the proposed solutions. Overall, I definitely think that the results from this project could be one way to improve Crunchyroll’s 
      user experience by giving it a visual update that optimizes content filters, helps improve navigational experience and user conversion, and increase 
      revenue. Definitely learned a lot from this project!
