<div class="crunchy-overview">
  <div class="crunchy-overview-head">WHAT IS CRUNCHYROLL AND ANIME?</div>
  <div class="crunchy-overview-body">Crunchyroll is an American video streaming platform that focuses on licensed 
    Japanese Anime and live-action drama. Anime is short for Japanese animation which is known for its 2-D and 
    stylized art style. In addition, Anime is heavily a part of Japanese culture and has a growing 
    international audience each year.
    <br><br>
    With over <b>70 million registered users </b>(updated July, 2020), <b>13 million monthly active users</b> (updated March, 2019), 
    and <b>3 million paying subscribers </b>(updated July, 2020), Crunchyroll is without a doubt the leading Anime streaming service.

  <div class="crunchy-business-body"><b>Crunchyroll’s main forms of revenue:</b>
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    I conducted an online survey with 11 responses that had a question with the intent on 
    finding out if these users use any other website aside from Crunchyroll to watch 
    Anime. <b>18.2% also use Funimation, 81.8% also use Netflix, 36.4% also use Hulu</b>, and 
    three of the responders also use YouTube, KissAnime, and Animelab.

    <br><br>
    Along with research on Crunchyroll’s business, I dug deeper to understand the UX problems. In my survey, I asked 
    the users how they felt about the current design layout, navigation experience, what pages they use the 
    most and the least, and any other issues they may have on the website. While the answers were mixed, feedback requested:
    <br><br>
    • <b>A UI update, especially the landing page and shows page.</b>
    <br><br>
    • <b>Dark mode.</b>
    <br><br>
    • <b>A way to organize their queue/watch lists.</b>
    <br><br>
    • <b>Filter options to improve the search engine.</b>
    <br><br>
    The feedback showed that the users who addressed their opinions towards the outdated design gave them a negative user 
    experience overall and the desire to have a way to organize their saved Anime into different playlists.

<div class="crunchy-redesign">
  <div class="crunchy-redesign-head">IDENTIFYING WHAT PAGES TO REDESIGN</div>
  <div class="crunchy-redesign-body">
    <b>Landing page</b> - My solution for this was to give Crunchyroll’s pages a spotlight of their 
    own through the landing page. My goal was to improve user conversion and increase revenue.
    <br><br>

    <div class="crunchy-redesign-landing">
      <img src="Crunchyroll/landing-page.png">
    </div>

    <br><br>
    <b>Shows Page</b> - Users should have the freedom to make their searches as quick and painless as possible. 
    Crunchyroll does have a filtration system for their search engine, but I believe it could be 
    improved as the current navigation can be confusing. 
    <br><br>

    <div class="crunchy-redesign-shows">
      <img src="Crunchyroll/shows page.png">
    </div>

    <br><br>
    <b>Queue List</b> - User feedback mentioned that favorited Anime is listed on the last viewed episode. 
    This sparks confusion because many Anime have multiple seasons.
    <br><br>
    I tested this myself with an Anime that I know that currently has 5 seasons. I previewed a random episode 
    from a random season and checked my queue list. It read as “Shokugeki no Soma — Episode 5 *title name*.” 
    My immediate thought was <b>“Episode 5 from which season?”</b>
    <br><br>

    <div class="crunchy-redesign-queue">
      <img src="Crunchyroll/watch-list.png">
    </div>

    <br><br>
    <b>Anime Info Page</b> - Feedback I received when a user visits the page of an Anime show is to make current shows 
    more apparent on its specific page and on the front page. The current layout is not visually engaging so I kept 
    in my mind to modernize it and <b>have the user feel they are paying for high quality content.</b>

  <div class="crunchy-persona-body">
    I created a persona based on the results of my user research. In addition, I implemented 
    other Crunchyroll statistics that I found while conducting my research; which drove my persona 
    to be a 22-year old Asian male who is a college student.
    <br><br>
    • <b>75% of subscribers are under the age of 35</b> (updated January 2016).
    <br><br>
    • <b>Median age of free users: 18 years old</b> (updated January 2016).

    <br><br>

    I took <b>4 Crunchyroll users</b> and had them test my prototype.
    <br><br>
    <b>Task Flow</b>
    <br><br>
    • Start on the home page.
    <br><br>
    • Navigate to the “Shows” page.
    <br><br>
    • Add an Anime from the “Shows” page to the Watch list.
    <br><br>
    • Navigate to the watch list page and add that Anime to a specific playlist.
    <br><br>
    • Finally, visit the page of that Anime.
    <br><br>
    <b>Results</b>
    <br><br>
    100% OF THE TESTERS LIKED THE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS, ESPECIALLY THE CONTENT FILTERS I ADDED ON THE SHOWS AND WATCH LIST PAGES.
    <br><br>
    <b>"I didn’t know they had a store."</b>
    <br><br>
    <b>“Easier to use than what Crunchyroll has right now.”</b>
    <br><br>
    <b>“Smoother. Feels like Hulu.”</b>
    <br><br>
    <b>“I would pay for Crunchyroll.”</b>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="crunchy-solution">
  <div class="crunchy-solution-head">MOVING FORWARD WITH THE DESIGN SOLUTIONS</div>
  <div class="crunchy-solution-body">
    <b>Storytelling</b> - By updating the design into a storytelling layout, and giving off Netflix and 
    Hulu vibes, the landing page is more visually engaging and each Crunchyroll page: Shows, Manga, 
    News, Store, and Games are highlighted. I believe this approach would increase revenue and 
    user conversion due to all Crunchyroll services being much more visible and clear call-to-actions 
    to subscribe to their premium service.
    <br><br>

    <div class="crunchy-landing-solution">
      <img src="Crunchyroll/Signed out UI Final.png">
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <b>Shows page</b> - User feedback desired dark mode as many commented about eye strain. In addition, I added more 
    white space so that the Anime listings has breathing room and can be processed more easily. I reduced the filtration 
    system to Trending, Seasonal, Drama, and Genres as filters such as “alphabetical,” are confusing and should be implemented 
    by default. Finally, I included a sorting filter to optimize the search engine.
    <br><br>

    <div class="crunchy-list-solution">
      <img src="Crunchyroll/Anime List UI.png">
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <b>Watch List</b> - I personally felt that not everyone will understand what a “queue list” is, so I decided to change the name 
    to “Watch list,” to give a bit more clarity on what this page does. 
    <br><br>
    Users can see what Anime are currently airing and options to organize their content. They have the 
    freedom to create multiple playlists, which can help organize content for users, especially those who happen to share their account 
    with multiple people. Finally, I added playlist and genre filters for quick and easy navigation.
    <br><br>

    <div class="crunchy-watch-list-solution">
      <img src="Crunchyroll/Watch List-redesign.png">
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <b>Show Info Page</b> - Is now more visually engaging by making the video preview much larger and more apparent. 
    In terms of functionality, when a user enters the page of an Anime series, their progress is saved according to the 
    last episode they watched. So when they return at a later time they can quickly continue where they left off.

  <div class="crunchy-thoughts-body">
    I had a great time doing this redesign and I’m proud of the results. If I could go back, I would do 
    more usability testing to maximize feedback on the proposed solutions.
    <br><br>
    Overall, I definitely think that the results from this project could be one way to improve Crunchyroll’s 
    user experience by giving it a visual update that optimizes content filters, helps improve navigational 
    experience and user conversion, and increase revenue.
