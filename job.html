        <h3>I went through a detailed UX process of identifying this ongoing problem, conducting research, and creating a mobile solution.</h3>
        <h3>This application aims to provide an intuitive user experience with a short, but empowering onboarding process, an optimized 
            search engine that quickly finds relevant communities and events, and a mentor and mentee system.</h3>

            of time seeking answers by digging through online articles or trying to find experienced creatives who can give them clear direction.
        </h3>
        <h3>Moreover, there is an abundance of online design and development communities filled with people with years of first-hand experience who want to educate and help new creatives get started in tech.
            However, these communities are hidden from standard Google searches and must be found through a thorough search on social networking platforms or word-of-mouth.
