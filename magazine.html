      Overview
    </h1>
    <h3 class="text-area">
      <p>A design challenge I took on during spring 2018 that required original 
        design and content, along with handcrafting the final product. In addition, 
        I was given the freedom to choose any topic I wanted to cover. As an avid 
        gamer, I wanted to cover the trending eSports culture and highlight the 
        environment gamers live in. 
        <br>
        <br>
        During the course of this project, I was still grasping the fundamentals 
        of design and this magazine pushed my creativity to its limits.

      Layout
    </h1>
    <h3 class="text-area">
      <p>During the process of designing the layout of the magazine, 
        I struggled because I had no prior knowledge of magazine design. 
        As I kept working on the layout and researching more about design, 
        my mentor began praising me for my improvements. This was a turning 
        point for me as a designer and I developed a hunger to improve my craft.

      <p>I continued experimenting with Typography and incorporating a grid 
        system for text-heavy pages. In addition, my mentor has a strong liking 
        towards bold and blown up type. His infatuation rubbed off on me and I 
        began incorporating blown up type to my designs.

      Reflections

      <p>This project was a turning point for my design career. 
        During the time I was making this magazine, I was experiencing 
        severe imposter syndrome and I felt that I was not fit to be in 
        the design industry. Thankfully, my mentor at the time, gave me 
        guidance and he pushed my limits as a designer. After producing 
        the final product, I gained more confidence and I developed the 
        hunger to continue improving my craft.
